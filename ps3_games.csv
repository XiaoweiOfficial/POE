Acceleration of SUGURI X-Edition,PlayStation 3,['Sony Online Entertainment'],Rockin' Android,"['Action', 'Fighting', 'Fighting', '3D', '2D', '2D']",E10+,15-Feb-11,['PC'],,"An extremely competent and original girl-on-girl (sans the one male character in the 12-character roster) competitive fighter/shooter with a great deal of flair, color, strategy, depth, and variety, all of which is well worth the ludicrously cheap $5.99 asking price, which even includes a bonus theme and the entire soundtrack. This could easily have been $14.99, and justifiably so. The amount of content present goes far beyond what's expected of a $5.99 throwaway title. This is definitely not a throwaway title. Aside from the different forms of Suguri, who all play fairly similarly, every character plays very uniquely, with their own strengths and weaknesses. As for what makes it unique, while the game does have a typical Hyper gauge that goes up depending on how many hits you get in or how many projectiles you absorb, it also has something called a Heat percentage. Normally, the Heat is at zero, and can go as high as 300%. The percentage Heat that you have is exactly how much extra damage you take from attacks; so if you have a percentage of 100, you will be given twice as much damage as normal. Heat is accumulated for the most part by dashing. Here's the thing: Dashing doesn't just get you out of the way of an attack. Dashing also leaves behind a trail of rings, which absorb enemy projectile attacks. When this happens, you absorb those projectiles into your Hyper gauge. Learning how to manage dashing and your Heat is critical to succeeding. This one particular mechanic is what differentiates this game from others of its type (of which there are few). It forces you to risk greatly lowering your defense to fill your Hyper gauge. Note that dashing also allows you to become invulnerable to some attacks, as does the Shield mechanic. Basically, all I'm saying is that this is one seriously complex game, and way more than what would be expected from a $5.99 fighting game with twelve anime characters, a handful of arenas, only a couple of modes, and some very nice bonuses in the form of story sequences for each major character (Sora, an unlockable character, has a very unique story sequence, and is the only sequence to be animated, despite being very short compared to the others). It's an excellent fighter, the characters all have personality and detailed backstory, the story modes are entertaining and humorous, the dialogue shifts from funny to shockingly macabre (Hae's backstory of being kidnapped and forced to stay in a dark room which she is not allowed to leave is stunningly heartrending, and was especially impacting and incredibly contrasting considering Saki's very lighthearted story involving pudding, cooking, and making people happy), and the game has a huge amount of personality with the cool fighting mechanics and flash to back it up. The added bonus story sequences are a great touch, and the two brief but entertaining story modes are also fun to play through. The bonus soundtrack provided, plus the theme and background, are very well done, and make that $5.99 even more worth it. For anyone with the slightest interest in fighters of this sort, especially those with a fan of manga-style characters and storylines, this is an obvious purchase. Mastering it is extremely difficult, and to learn the ins and outs of its mechanics takes time and practice. Just remember to read the wiki of this to have an idea of where to start.

Ar tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ciel,PlayStation 3,['NIS America'],Gust,"['Role-Playing', 'Console-style RPG', 'Console-style RPG', 'Japanese-Style']",M,15-Mar-11,,No Online Multiplayer,"I'll admit it, I'm a sappy, sentimental, romantic kinda guy, growing up on games like Lunar and Grandia I really came to enjoy a good love story in my RPGs. Sadly for many RPGs a love interest is just shoehorned in, a tacked on extra or a checkbox in the big list of stuff they think they have to include, so much so that many people think they're pointless or add nothing to the game or even detract from it. So when the Ar Tonelico series came along I was really excited to see a series that really went for it with the love story. Of course I'm several hundred RPGs on since I started and there's a lot of things I like in an RPG, good music, a well thought out world that feels alive and has a sense of culture, large swathes of character interaction, likeable characters, a battle system that is both fun and different etc. Thankfully Qoga succeeds in a number of these categories and excels in a few.As with the other games in the series, Ar Tonelico Qoga takes place in a tower above their inhospitable planet of Ar Ciel which has been covered by the sea of death. Unlike the other games where reyvateils were partners and lived among humans or below them, in this area reyvateils dominate over humans and carry out cleansings and purifications, either killing humans or enslaving them in the name of Clustania. The scale of the story is both massive in scope and minute in detail and is constantly balancing between intimate personal issues, large scale political movements and events with world changing consequences in a really satisfying way.Of course the story hinges on the two female leads, Saki and Finnel. They're reyvateils, a race of artificially created(though still biological) humanoids with the ability to use song magic. Saki is optimistic and innocent, Finnel is pessimistic and cynical, two fairly standard personality types, however when you begin to unfold the events that molded their personality they really become great, memorable characters. A further and unique level of complexity is added to them in the form of their personae. Both of them have a number of alternate personalities that govern aspects of their personalities. Sarapatra for example is a more mature, adult side of Saki. I can't talk too much more about them without spoiling some of the fantastic twists and turns of the story but you're left questioning if these personae are truly other sides of them or something else as they often work against their other sides desires.The other vanguard characters, Tatsumi and Hikari, took me by surprise with how great they were too. With such an emphasis on the romance between the hero and heroines you'd expect them to take a backstage and play a bit part, but no, they have their own story and goals which you help them to achieve while they help Aoto with his quest too. In fact in the early stages of the game Tatsumi is so preoccupied with pursuing his own agenda that he seems pretty cold and seems to be constantly looking for an opportunity to leave the group. He just cant ignore Aoto's troubles though and through the course of the game develops to be a really great friend.Even beyond the main cast, many of the NPCs have amazingly well thought out stories, some of them even tying back into plot threads through the previous two games in the series. I particularly enjoyed Mute, Akane and Richaryosha. Mute is a massive muscular melee fighter, completely railing against the regular idea of a reyvateil as a songstress summoner. Despite her role as an enemy early on and her fearsome appearance she's quite a sweetie at heart and can be oddly cute at times. Though still terrifying when running around shouting HONEY! DARLING! Akane too is an enemy to Aoto, but she's also Finnel's childhood friend. she's a cold hearted ruthless commander at first, but if you're a good enough friend to Finnel you might just end up being friends with Akane too.The crowning glory of the Ar Tonelico series is definitely it's hymmnos, songs that are sung in a language specially created for the games.  There are a couple of oddball tracks in there, particularly CUTYPUMP and EP=NOVA are strange tracks that I didn't like at first, but suit the characters really well. They hugely expanded the number of vocal artists working on this game and some of them are really great, KOKIA's tracks are beautiful. The rest of the soundtrack isn't quite as great and might be slightly disappointing to fans of the previous games but dont misunderstand, it's still a wonderful OST, better than almost everything else out there. It just had an unbelievable pedigree to live up to. Some of the slower tracks used in the more emotional and intimate scenes are really memorable soulful pieces.Overall out of the hundreds of RPGs I've played this will be one of those I really cherish, it's the only RPG so far this gen other than Valkyria Chronicles I feel is really a classic in the making.",61,Mixed or average reviews,6,16,5,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,54,10,11

Arrogant, self-serving and lustful for gold and glory, Beowulf journeys to Denmark to destroy a bloodthirsty beast wreaking havoc on a frigid land. But evil persists, and Beowulf succumbs to its lure of even greater fame, quietly maneuvering to claim the Danish throne. As King, Beowulf must face the consequences of ambition, even as war descends on the realm. As Beowulf, players lead their men, called thanes, into battle, slay the Titans of a dying age and crush the enemies that threaten to annihilate both their kingdom and people. Only then, when Beowulf looks Destiny in the eye, will he know what kind of hero he has truly become. Army of up to 12 thanes to unlock as players increase their heroic experience (by saving thanes, killing giant monsters, etc.). Players use the thane army to their advantage by giving orders, assigning positions, tailoring weapons to the situation or enemy and by triggering in-game mechanisms. The thane army evolves with upgradeable weapons (swords, mace and spears), skills and abilities. Use legacy experience points to gain thanes, replace weapons and upgrade Carnal abilities. Carnal Power allows the use of stronger attacks and special weapons. Carnal upgrades include less daze after use and prolonged use of Carnal Fury. But if used too much, there will be grave consequences. Dynamic combat system including combos, parries and increasing skills as the player progresses. Grab ability allows Beowulf to hold on to walls or climb, as well as fight up close with visceral hand-to-hand combat against enemies and giant monsters.

Extend however, while it is very good, questions wether it should exist in the first place. Chrono Phantasma Extend biggest offering is new pieces of story to it's overall narrative. They are entertaining, are told very well and they are wonderfully acted by pretty much everyone. Remix Heart Gaiden is also very entertaining, but we'll get to that later. The gameplay is still the one from Chrono Phantasma, and that's a good thing: It's fast, frantic, stylish and beautiful to look at. The new characters, Celica and the returning Lambda, are fun to play and are unique. This game pretty much is Chrono Phantasma, but just more to it..... ......however, it didn't add enough for it to be worth a new entry in the series. Everything offered in this game could have been sold as DLC, but instead it's turned into a full priced game. ASW really needs to stop doing this as it really hurts their image in the long run as being very greedy. Remix Heart Gaiden, despite being very entertaining and well voice acted, is incredibly short and considering the novel, much more would have been added to the overall story of Remix Heart. Considering how short it is, one even bothers why to include it all, which is a shame. Also the balancing is a bit off in Extend. Characters like Hazama get buffed, but characters like Terumi get nerfed. I question that because Hazama was one of the best in the original version and Terumi was nothing special, yet Terumi gets hit with the nerf stick, and Hazama gets more combo options.....i don't get why they thought it was a good idea. There are other characters that are also a bit too good (Valkenhayn, Nu) Even though i really like and enjoy Chrono Phantasma Extend, it really should have offered more in terms of content, like more characters and story bits, and balance the characters that should have been balanced accordingly instead nerfing or buffing characters that don't deserve them. Overall, i recommend this game to all hardcore BlazBlue fans. If you never owned Chrono Phantasma, this is a good place to start off with, but if you already owned Chrono Phantasma, i would say wait until a new patch comes along.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,12,0,2

Beyond the action-packed racing filled with fast curves, sneaky alternate routes, hair-raising jumps and fully realized damage models that provide for spectacular crashes, Blur’s narrative is presented through Bizarre’s new community-based interface, reaching far beyond the game itself. This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur’s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game. These new modes are immediately shared through Blur’s social network, expanding the game in ways that are only limited by the gaming community’s creativity.

Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race. Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology.

The game takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today's military practices have converged with powerful consequences.

I didn't play the game long enough to see if they had cut any character dialogue or not, but it didn't seem like they had. Hard to say though, you didn't hear them talk as much because there aren't as many deaths with the way the new games is, which leads me into all the things that I have a problem with in the HD remake (that I would like to point out did not advertise any changes to the gameplay anywhere) This new group decided to add a health meter to the game. It take way too long to kill people, I mean we're talking >1 weapon pickup per kill in some cases. The special weapons are **** useless, harpooning is useless, environmental hazards (for the most part) do nothing. They added multipliers for doing ""tricks"" and hitting people, very easily exploited with certain weapons. Oh, and all the crazy deaths are gone for the most part. No more incinerating people with Flemming or chewing people up with Cinder's woodchipper. Hell, a nuke isn't even enough to kill someone. They did add new weapons, which is cool...i guess. That is, they would be if they weren't just copies of already existing ones (Javelin=short range harpoon gun, electricity ray=freeze ray [same animation], tnt sheep=grenade, scimitar=axe/chainsaw [neither of which cut through people anymore]). If it really was just a graphical overhaul it would be a much better game. As it is now, the pacing is way too slow and the way they calculate smacks just doesn't seem right. Melee weapons are way **** overpowered (i.e. Old school boxing gloves were really only useful for environmental hazards. Now?

To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey.

Defying gravity in vertical combat is only half the battle as, over time, Will is upgraded to a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat as gamers are able to fly through the void at unparallel speeds shooting down anything that gets in their path. Blasting away at massive bosses has never been this much fun as Dark Void offers a unique grip system made up of a variety of grip-based mini-games including skyjacking UFOs mid-flight.

Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten - The Flashback Episode,PlayStation 3,['NIS America'],Nippon Ichi Software,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Tactics']",T,13-Mar-12,,,"Like most anime inspired jRPG makers, NI really likes to shovel out the DLC for their RPGs.  Disgaea 4 already has more cost in DLC than the original game, with more to come yet!  This is the first DLC that actually adds more story to the game and will have the most people interested, so I'll give this one a quick review of what you get for your $4.  There are four levels in a new chapter available in the postgame.  The dialogue is fully voiced unlike the other DLC so far.  The four levels use recycled maps from the main game, though with new enemy placements and a minor geo puzzle on the last map.  These new maps are super easy as you're given access to the past version of Valvatorez who has godlike stats.  If you were hoping for a deep storyline into the past of the two main characters, you won't find one.  You do get a bit a of background on how the two met up, and why Fenrich eventually pledged his undying loyalty.  At the end of it all, the game quietly gives you access to Tyrant Valvatorez as a playable character (though with his level and stats normalized) without any fanfare.  He's arguably the strongest character in the game once levelled, so powergamers will no doubt want this regardless.  Compared to the rest of the Disgaea 4 DLC, this one is above average as it's only $1 more than the others yet comes with some actual storyline content.  Compared to DLC in general the Disgaea 4 stuff is pretty overpriced at $3 per character, with no other content except a brief unvoiced introduction scene and one or two new BGMs.  If you just can't get enough of Disgaea 4, go ahead and pick this one up over the other DLC.  However if you've already competed most of Disgaea 4's postgame content this will be little more than a brief distraction.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0

My wife and I finished the avengers story mission in about 4 hours of game-play. The avengers city is a little bigger than The Incredibles from DI1, but it has a huge vertical aspect to it. I was a little disappointed that the only interiors I could access were the specific levels in the story. ""Flight"" was pretty essential to my wife and I beating the game as fast as we did.  It's faster than running and helped us avoid using tricky to find elevators and jump pads to reach the top of buildings. We played as Thor and Iron Man who come with the box set, but also had the other avenger's characters available at launch. The other characters had some neat abilities but without flight they slowed the game down too much. My favorite aspect of the game was leveling up different characters because I got more than a pretty statue in the Hall of Heroes. In true RPG fashion each hero could upgrade different abilities and attacks as they leveled up. I greatly enjoyed this process and it made reaching a new level something to chase after rather than an afterthought. The 2.0 Toy Box is a big melting pot of minecraft, the sims, and build it yourself mini games. The ""my Interior"" part of the game is a nostalgia sidequest extravaganza of characters like Scrooge McDuck, The Genie, and Belle having me add furniture, rooms and windows to my house full of little Disney people. If you're into Disney or House/Room customization this is a fun add on to the game. I also had the blessing(CURSE) of the two Toybox games that came with the starter set. The Assault on Asgard was the lesser of two evils, but with my high level flying characters it wasn't very challenging. It's a basic tower defense game with the ability to lay traps down to protect Asgardian Artifacts. It didn't add in any of the toy box enemies and continued to reuse the same frost giants from The Avengers playset.  ""Escape from the Kyln"" was an annoying overhead action series of finding loot for your minion who accompanied you through each level. These levels were easy until glitchy things made them difficult. My character would get stuck on objects, fly off the edge, or he would be obstructed by buildings, walls etc so I couldn't see who I was fighting. In two player both players share the screen but only one can control the camera (which is weird because the game handles 2 players so well in the avengers playset and in the Assault on Asgard game.) ""Exploration survival mode"" was a 4 hour slog of fighting enemies that increased in difficulty. As hard as this 50 level section was (no saves allowed and when a character dies they are dead) it did add interesting features. I faced bad guys from all over the Disney universe which forced me to adapt my play style significantly. I also lost Captain America around level 25 and had to complete the game with Thor. I kept wishing I could save and come back but the game doesn't let you so at 1:30am I finally had earned my trophy. This mode is not for a casual sit down, or to run through with a seven year old. It made me think of games as a kid where there were no save points, and you had to be committed to win. Somehow Disney tapped into my oldschool gaming as well as old school Disney movies and my love for super heroes all at once. (still not ready to forgive the ""escape from the kyln"" game). The actual toybox is very similar to the 1.0 edition. It adds builders to the mix so you can watch the machine build cool stuff for you. Downloading levels and user created games are very hit or miss. There are plenty of toys, and if you put the toy set piece from the 1.0 toy sets on the base you immediately get all of their toys. Seriously Minecraft is a better do it yourself sandbox world builder, and if you don't have a Disney fetish this part of the game isn't going to hold your interest for too long. I made a race track, and a tree house, but eventually the game just wore out on me. My biggest grievance is that even with a full play-through of the avengers play set, beating both toy box games, and the survival mode, I still didn't have enough sparks to unlock all the toys. Maybe once I get the other toy sets I'll have enough but I'm guessing multiple playthroughs with multiple characters is going to be the answer to unlocking all the toys. In conclusion: This game is fun and on sale for Black Friday. It ate up a good thirty hours of my time through all the game modes which was mostly enjoyable. + Flight Characters+ RPG elements+ My interior and Survival mode+ No more spin for your toys in toy box- non flight characters- Toy box games- Not enough sparks to buy the toys i wanted.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,5.1,Mixed or average reviews,2,2,3

Same reason you don't ignore all your other pieces in chess and just move the queen!  ... Idiot.  At least take the time to understand a game before you put up a ""professional"" review.  Swedish review is better but still seemingly suffers from not completely understanding the game.  The main critique of not being able to play local multiplayer shows they also don't quite understand the game.  What are you going to do, tell your partner to close their eyes and not peek while you take turns setting up the board and then while you play the game take turns closing your eyes when you select combat cards...!?  This game does not work as a local multiplayer game.  Swedish review also noted lack of campaign.  What if the challenges were simply relabeled, Campaign.  That is essentially exactly what they could be. If you want to play strategic, zero chance, and highly competitive, very fun game on the PS3 you can't go wrong with DungeonTwister.  If it supported asynchronous play (not sure this is even possible on PS3, need DT on IPad!)  it would be perfect.  Yes, the graphics are dated, the audio, in particular the grunts of each character when you select them will be quickly muted, but that is not what this game is about.

I would give the PC version a 10/10 with no hesitation. However, the PS3 version is the worst port I have ever played. The reasons for this are: 1) Obnoxiously long load times (Dustforce on PC had no loading screens, at all). It takes around a minute to get from initial boot to the hub world. On PC, it took about two seconds. I am not exaggerating.2) No cross-buy (PS3 and Vita versions are separate games).3) Framerate is jumpy. This becomes much worse when moving quickly.4) Audio lag. You can't go a whole minute without hearing some form of audio lag. Also, the audio lags consistently at the end of every run, and while attacking enemies at higher speeds.5) The new UI looks cheap and out-of-place.6) No custom controls.7) The clipping is off. I watched myself pass through objects that should have been solid several times on the PS3 version.8) Absolutely none of the previously listed issues are present on the PC version of the game. If future updates fix these issues, I will change my rating to a 10. Anyways, lets all thank Q-loc and Capcom taking a truly superb platforming experience and slaughtering it before the eyes of the console community.

I loved Dynasty Warriors 6 and 7, even though perhaps they had annoying flaws  but this game almost seems like KOEI listened to the fans, and gave them what they really wanted this time around!!  The presentation is good, granted there is a little slowdown at times, but for most of the time there are hundreds of antagonists on screen and it runs just beautifully.  The backdrops have a little bit of variety to them, but its the characters that steal the show, for they are beautiful.  The music, voiceovers and FX are exactly what you'd expect for Dynasty Warriors, but this isn't a complaint, for if it were different, this would not be Dynasty Warriors  live with it, enjoy it, and be done.  Gameplay-wize the game is just sublime!!  The Story mode is hugely branching, also chucking in some severely smart (and huge!!) battles, the Free mode is a welcome addition marking a return, and Ambition mode is more than a tacked-on extra  it must really kill KOEI that they have made every single 'Empires' version of Dynasty Warriors almost obsolete!!  Well, it seems like that to me!!  Combat is the usual, but its hefty, and thanks to some honestly genius forethought, you have more power over how your character performs in the heat of battle, when they meet certain criteria (yes, it does make a huge difference!!).  That, and simple things, like calling your horse and jumping on it with a single button, may seem simple but they add much to the whole feeling of the combat in this game  huge, slick, fast, and of a coordinated chaotic ballet, and in many way the repetition of the combat is somewhat tempered, though I can understand the repetition may come through on occasion.  I would normally give this a 9, saying that its really a specialist kind of a game, and that for the cost it is, you'd really have to commit to this (or play a demo).  But be damned, in this time ironically, this is a fresh vital thing, not just to the series, but of software in general to play at the moment.  I personally give this a 10, as I think its that good  its now up to you, if you haven't played this series in a long time, to decide whether its worth the outlay, but I still urge you to try it.",68,Mixed or average reviews,11,14,1,8.1,Generally favorable reviews,61,17,7

Fans of the previous game like me, will instantly love how you can still squash, shoot, and knock lights down on the enemies. This game adds new elements to make it feel fresh, with things like door kills, knockouts, bombs, switches, and even medals to earn. There is a story, but that's not why you'd buy the game, so it's not really important. The game also has a high replay value, in which it has leaderboards, medals to earn, 4-player co-op, and the orginal game.

F1 2012,PlayStation 3,['Codemasters'],Codemasters,"['Driving', 'Racing', 'Simulation', 'Formula One', 'Formula One', 'Automobile']",E,18-Sep-12,"['PC', 'Xbox 360']",Up to 16,"Codemasters have yet again delivered us a fantastic racing game for all types of gamers. Notoriously this is a fans game, much like other sports games, if you`re a fan of the sport, you will love this game and be able to comprehend the technical side of things (Limited as they may be in the game). Theres a definite equalisation between wheel users and controller users, unlike the last game, where anyone with a wheel had an automatic 3 second per lap advantage over controller users. This time, we controller users can really take the fight to them! The graphics are a great improvement over the last version, with the cars and environment looking especially nice. Wet weather has had a BIG improvement, the graphics on track and off the rain heading towards the track is very immersive and wet weather has become very tricky to drive on now. The major changes to the game are important to note as of course they match real life changes in the sport: - No blown diffuser, this is the big change in the game, you will notice a huge difference in traction at low speed corners and mid speed corners without this diffuser. In 2012, you really have to apply the throttle gradually coming out of any hairpins, or even chicanes otherwise because of the reduced downforce given from the BD, you will spin out. This is noticeable in the mid-speed corners too if you try and turn in a little bit too early or correct in the middle of a sweeping corner youll find the car a lot more twitchy on the steering and will risk spinning. Lots more car control required, just what we like! braking bias -  Although i havent tested the braking bias extensively yet, ive had a few stabs at it here and there, you can get through most corners on all tracks without switching your brake bias to the front or rear while out on track, However ive noticed a few lock ups when trying to brake a bit later and gain lap time. So it will definitely aid in eeking out those final tengths. -A.I. Finally the computer are worth racing, theyve really amped up the difficulty on the computer. I know for most of us the computer SUCKED in previous games, it was normal to be faster than the computer by 3 seconds a lap on legend difficulty. Not now though, in multiplayer ive seen legend difficulty destroy some people on the wheels. I myself havent struggled overly with the A.I but they are definitely more competitive, and will hound you especially with the huge DRS boost. In single player they were a lot mor challenging, especially when in a force india, Im not sure if its because i didnt have setups yet, but Paul di resta was beating my ass in qualifying which was a big surprise, Im pretty sure he outqualified me by over a second. Some of that may be down to the lack of a full setup, some the difficulty increase in the A.I All in all a very enjoyable game for a fan especially, the car sounds have been vastly improve, the graphics are good, the racing is fantastic and i love racing the game so far. Possible improvements:  - More interaction with interviewers- More technical analysis for us true fans",81,Generally favorable reviews,20,3,0,7.5,Generally favorable reviews,44,4,9

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before.

Gran Turismo 5,PlayStation 3,['SCEA'],Polyphony Digital,"['Driving', 'Racing', 'Simulation', 'GT / Street', 'GT / Street', 'Automobile']",E,24-Nov-10,,Up to 6,"Gran turismo games have always been the benchmark for all other racers to compare to. GT5 is no different in status, but even better than anything before. The basic structure of a GT game is present, but it's streamlined and enhanced into the best yet. As usual for a first on console GT title, the new cars are somewhat limited (220 about) but in this one, you also get upgraded versions of nearly every car that has ever graced the series as well as almost every track from the series, with some new tracks. The biggest difference for GT5 is the tracks. Not only do you get the classics, you get new & very exciting tracks as well as tracks capable of transitioning from day to night racing as well as having unpredictable weather patterns including rain, fog, and snow on rally tracks. Rally racing is better than ever also. The new driving physics make this game the most realistic or the most accessible depending on how you set the driving aids. The re-playability is unmatched by any game no matter what the genre. Not only is there a great customizable online portion to the game, but an unlimited variety of city, circuit, dirt, snow, and go kart tracks provided by the robust course maker option. The course maker is one of the most ingenius new features to any racing game. GT5 already has more tracks than most games, and they extended that even further with a course maker that is not only easy to use but capable of producing high quality tracks that rival any other video games original tracks. Oh yea, did I mention go karts? Karting is one of the most basic but most fun types of racing there is. In GT5, it's one of the few occasions where you have as much fun doing it virtually as you would in real life. The karts handle insanely accurately to their real life counterparts but the similarities between vitrual and real are even more evident with full sized cars. No game, not even PC sims do a better job at mimicking a cars behavior in real life than GT5. It makes collecting cars the most fun part of the game to some, me included. The karting addition is so fun, most newcomers say it alone could be it's own game. NASCAR has also been added. I'm not a fan of NASCAR at all & I was skeptical but I really have to admit, GT5 is going to open up a lot of people around the world to a great sport. Right from the start, it's hard not to instantly love NASCAR cars even on a road course. Of course, these are only the major new features of GT5. There are many smaller additions to the game that just make it what it is, which is the greatest racing game of all time. Little things like interior view driver positioning, replays, custom soundtracks, and photomode are just some of the few details that really need to be experienced to understand. All of the small details aren't positive however. In some cars on day to night tracks, the shadows are very jagged and can be very distracting during replays. Luckily, the shadows are smoothed out in photomode but not while driving or watching. The standard cars do not have interior. That's a big issue that should be fixed but in hindsight, it's really not a big deal while your into the game. The standard cars can be damaged and look great, but the consistency is not there. Not all standards can be damaged. The damage is another small issue. It's realistic looking once it happens but it's hard to really damage a car but if you've played GT before, you know it's not about crashing, it's about racing. An issue that has plagued GT games in the past is now officially gone (at least for the premium cars). Engine sounds are absolutely amazing and even more so accurate. You can literally hope on the top gear track, and drive a car while watching the review on the show, and you won't be able to tell the difference in the engine sound. Also, the collision sounds are spectaculor and very realistic although hopefully, you don't know how a car accident sounds. When you get into a different car in your garage, a true to life start up of the car you choose is instantly heard even with the standard cars and this is just another example of really cool details in this game that help to balance out the issues this game has. It's not a perfect game, but there is only minor tweaks needed for perfection and with online connectivity, it's very possible we will see this game perfected, because on thing is for sure, it will keep you busy for years. No other game has the replayability this game has, and no other game has more to offer. Not enough words can describe why this is the best racer of all time, please just buy the game, play it, and enjoy",84,Generally favorable reviews,66,16,0,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,921,222,153

Furthermore, when connected to the Playstation Network, the player can upload their times and view the Top 10 rankings for each car and mode, as well as play and save replays online. In ""Time Trial"" mode, the player selects a car and must complete the Eiger Nordwand course within the target time indicated at the top of the screen. Each time the player beats the target time, a new car is unlocked and made available for selection. As stated, upon unlocking all of the cars, the player can access tuned cars, along with the option to race Eiger Nordwand in the opposite direction. In ""Drift Trial"" mode, the players drifting technique is tested, rather than their lap time. The player earns drift points based on their drift angles, racing lines, and speeds within evaluation zones located at various turns on the course. For each evaluation zone, the results are based on the number of flags and a numerical figure. The point total from all zones determines the players drift points for the lap and is counted toward the rankings. [SCEA]",82,Generally favorable reviews,5,0,0,6.7,Mixed or average reviews,12,5,5

As a history enthusiast, I loved this alternative take on the famous Shinsengumi combined with a romance subplot - it's easy to grow attached to one or more of the warriors with their varying personalities (calm and gentle Saito, gruff and no-nonsense Hijikata, etc.) and the resulting romance is touching, but it doesn't dominate the story and won't alienate those who're not, either. The extra stories in the Zuisouroku fandisk allow you to get to know the Shinsengumi even better via some quieter moments where you're not desperately fighting for your lives in-game, which is nice.

When it throws you into it's world(s) it does so without any explanation as to what your goals are or how you are supposed to complete them. The thrill of discovery is actually a pretty big driving point on the experience. Once the overall objective becomes clear you can set goals for yourself and have more fun exploring the unique worlds the game has to offer. Even then though you have to figure out how to complete your goals and that is also part of the fun. However I won't lie and tell you that the game's lack of direction isn't frustrating at times. Completing the goals in order to progress to the end often just requires random experimentation. You can interact with the environments in a number of different ways. Only one way will contribute to your overall objective. Some of the solutions can seem kind of random. Especially the larger ones. Some hints or clues as to what you are supposed to do in each world would have been pretty helpful. Completing some of them just comes down to blind luck. However that doesn't mean the game isn't fun. Quite the opposite actually. Exploring it's world and hitting that eureka moment is a blast. The charming visuals and excellent soundtrack that reacts to your interactions only add to it. There's a lot of charm here. The gameplay experience mostly consists of playing as a flying snakelike creature who can have the inhabitants of the world ride on him and fly over things or bump into them to make them do something. Depending on the world though unique changes occur. Each word also has it's own unique them and puzzles. This is the type of game I recommend if you are looking for something new.

After seeing gameplay of it over a year ago from quite a small YouTuber, I really did not have high hopes. I even thought it was a fan made game, seeing as I thought that was the only plausible reason I'd see Naruto and Goku fighting in the same game. Turns out, the combat (once I was used to it mind you), I actually genuinely love. There is a certain skill to it, and learning the combos and timings of each characters is extremely satisfying. A tactic I like to use with Naruto is to do O+UP to send a shadow clone running towards the enemy, then R1+O to activate Sage mode and unleash my combos, dealing heavy damage. There is just a level of satisfaction you get from pulling them off. Only bad thing I will say is, some characters seem a bit over powered, and can also shoot of their specials at times seemingly endlessly. If you are a massive fan of fighting games and anime, I'd advise you pick this up immediately.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle,PlayStation 3,"['Namco Bandai Games America', 'Namco Bandai Games']",CyberConnect2,"['Fighting', '3D', 'Action', 'Fighting', '3D']",T,29-Apr-14,,2,"A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won't be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there's one thing you can truly say about this game, it's that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it's based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can't fight as them, at the very least you're likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game's menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game's release was such an affair that the game itself had it's own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks. The game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it's core is a pretty solid fighter. It's not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren't going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don't play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos. One thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with ""Chummiiii!"" sounds), you can use all of Mista's Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they're going to say next. As I've said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it's a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff ""Polnareff"" even if the subtitles say ""Eiffel"". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you've read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out ""Stone Free!"" or Giorno saying ""Gold Experience Requiem!"" among others. Overall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, you're just depriving yourself if you don't buy this game. If you're a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend's house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I'd give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.",71,Mixed or average reviews,21,32,0,8.1,Generally favorable reviews,64,15,9

It is quite a drastic change in feel to the game. The graphics are much improved and the PS3 can actually handle the game so no screen tears and presumably  some tweaks on gameplay as well. Now the game isn't as clunky but has retained the base feel and with better graphics at 720 rather than 480 it's looking way better. In addition to hd rendering, It seems some gameplay features got a remaster as well, such as the zoom on sniper rifles ect the game is more refined than the original. As I mentioned in my ps2 review this comes at the cost of immersion but props to this version. You can now decide which feel or version you prefer and I think this version generationally improves the game.

Nice to go around the campus at night, breaking into the school and to play the ""young investigators"", certainly very beautiful the scene in the pool, sure a ""different"" moment, then move on to the escape and back to Chloe's house. There were also quite clever uses of Max's powers, such as the one with Warren's bomb to open the principal's office closed door, or the one where Max needs to steal Frank's camper keys without he finds out. However, in all this, apart the discovery that Rachel and Frank were doing more than Chloe thought – with the obvious 5-years old child hysteria by her – is that the plot has not been evolved particularly. So between good moments and certainly important scenes (but without real developments), the impression is that ""Chaos Theory"" has given less than it should. And then, there's the final section: ok, it's a breakthrough. Max, through a photograph, goes back in time – for the first time: back in time, not rewinding, or at least she never rewound so much – up to 5 years before. She finds herself in Chloe's house, as a 13-years old girl, a few minutes before her father takes the car and goes to his death, just exactly how things happened. Then? Then, with spontaneity – assuming that, in Life is Strange, time is represented in the wrong way, but it's ok, since the Novikov self-consistency principle is more complicated even if more ""accurate"" – Max saves Chloe's father and manages to change the past and thus the future, or more realistically to create a fracture in the spacetime in which an alternative story has developed, in which things are different. She is a member of the Vortex Club, David is a bus driver, her friend Warren... is no longer her friend. And finally, here comes the twist: though Chloe's father survived... his daughter finds herself paralyzed in a wheelchair. And it is here that finally the name of the episode, ""Chaos Theory"", assumes its meaning. But only at the end, in the last 10 minutes at most. It was nice but there is no doubt that, from an episode almost as long as the previous two, it was expected something more. Maybe, there are now more questions than answers... than before. And only two episodes are remaining to the end of the story. And this new alternative universe? I wonder how it can end.

So your movements become cautious, you want to study the seemingly insignificant ground before you step forth.Animations are smooth as silk.

Further disappointments are found in the AI, baserunning, and fielding.  Fielding seems ""wonky"" as opposed to smooth and natural and allows outfielders and middle infielders make impressive defensive plays too often, baserunning (at least for me) seems overly complicated, and most importantly the AI fails to make good baseball decisions by holding runners when it shouldnt.

The controls are better on PS3, graphics are nicer, and the depth of the game is incredible. Go read the PSP reviews to get a feel for what you're in for, I don't need to reinvent the wheel, but suffice to say, this game has everything. From shooting action, to sneaking, to capturing soldiers, to endless challenges...beating the game is just the beginning of your journey in Peace Walker. Anyone who goes into Ground Zeroes and the upcoming Phantom Pain are missing out on the storyline if they don't play through this at least once. Chico and Paz are central characters here and the ""what happened to them next"" carries over into Ground Zeroes. It has been said that this game is the Metal Gear game Kojima wanted to make as a real sequel to MGS3, and it shows. It has all the trademark humor, collectibles, challenge, boss battles, etc. that MGS4 was missing. I really can't say enough good things about this. If you're a fan of the series and you feel like killing a LOT of time, there is plenty to do here. I believe it can be beaten up to 200% once all the final objectives and side ops are complete. There are even some insane arena battles ripped straight from Monster Hunter. Initially, it was designed around co-op (local multiplayer with nearby PSP players is baked in and expected for certain things) but the HD version is a little harder to get through since the game has ""had it's day"" already and has dropped off in popularity. Still, you may be able to find a few people in the middle of the night to join up with for co-op if you're going for total completion. This isn't necessary to ""beat"" the game, but it's useful and almost completely necessary to beat the extra ops. If you want to get a feel for what's next in the series, Peace Walker HD is the right place to start, because after I completed the initial mission in Ground Zeroes, PW HD is all I could think about.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,65,15,8

Anybody who has played these games the past couple years will notice a graphical advancement, while those putting on the cleats for the first time will be spending most of their time picking their jaws off the floor. But, once again, its what Sony has done under the hood that makes this game a true standout. The new ball physics are a huge leap forward in sports games. Each ball, hit, pitch...play carries its own spin. Where and how you hit the baseball affects the spin on the ball which in turn makes each hop, bounce and hit off the bat lifelike and completely unpredictable. Your games will keep you at the edge of your seat as the game forces each ounce of your attention.

I mean it's a board game. There is some downloadable content but the thing is most of them are not free, which is pretty stupid.

Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,['505 Games'],Artificial Mind and Movement,"['Action', 'General', 'General']",T,25-Jun-10,"['iPhone/iPad', 'Xbox 360']",Up to 4,"Intro:In my gaming years I have never come across a game where you play as a teddy bear who kills other teddy bears, this makes Naughty Bear a very original idea.Story:In Naughty Bear the story starts off with Naughty not getting invited to Daddles' birthday party, so he goes and takes a present anyway, so he does that and gets laughed at. He has had enough of being bullied by the other bears, so he decides to go on a rampage. After this more things start to happen, like Army Bears attack you, Robots attack you, ninja's attack you and aliens attack you. You can tell it is an eventful game.Gameplay:Naughty bears gameplay is a dream come true, there is special moves like, sticking bears in fridges, brutally axing them and much more. There is a fairly big selection of weapons to use, from simple twigs to uzi's. You can also press L2/LT to roar, which will usually cause bears to run away in fear and if you scare them enough you can cause them to go insane and they will end up killing themselves. The only downsides I found with the gameplay is that you can't jump and it has afew lag problems, other than that its really impressive.Presentation:For 2010 Naughty Bear's graphic's are pretty basic. Although the graphics are nothing special, they don't look horrible, they actually go with the game. The cartoony style of this game fits in well. The bears and the environment are very colourful and nice to look at. The presentation of the menu was a big highlight for me because it looked way better than most other menu's, like the boring menu of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.Sounds:Although the bears only make squeaky noises, there is a commentator that is sort of the voice in Naughty's head that sounds great. He has an English accent and in my opinion deserves an award for his awesome voice acting. The guns and weapons make good sound when they hit a bear. There is one noise you will get used to, ROAR! You will get used to this because you will have to scare bears quite a lot in this game. The music in the game is like the music in a young children's TV show, but the music changes to a more serious tune when you start to cause loads of chaos.Multiplayer:Finding a game on Naughty Bear online can be hard sometimes, but when you do you will have a lot of fun. There are four game types, which are,Assault: In this mode There is two teams, one being red bears, one being blue bears. In this game mode, you will be trying to either destroy the other teams statue or protect your own one with your other team member. If a statue gets destroyed, the round ends and you will switch from Attack to Defence or Defence to attack.Cake Walk: In this mode, one player will have a cake and will have to hold it for as long as possible, while other players will try to kill that player for it.Golden Uzi: In this mode there is a powerful uzi(which is golden), that has infinite ammo and is very powerful. Players will have to try and retrieve the golden uzi, by either simply picking it up or just killing the player that has it in there possession and then picking it up.Jelly Wars: In this mode, you will either play as a normal bear or Naughty Bear. Three players will be normal bears and one player will be Naughty Bear. In this mode the normal bears objective is to find jelly and put it in a giant mixer, to make one giant jelly. The player that is playing as Naughty Bear will have to try and stop and kill these innocent bears who are just making jelly.Life-Span: Naughty Bear will last you a long time if you go back to levels and try and beat your score. You can also play the very addictive multiplayer, which will last you a while if you enjoy it as much as I do.Overall: This is a great game with some minor flaws that don't ruin it at all.Rating: 10/10",43,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,13,18,5.8,Mixed or average reviews,23,17,19

With plenty of black humour and dark irony, this game immerses the player in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Your word is law as you become the all powerful Overlord, a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil after being raised from the dead. The game's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures – the Minions. Accompanied by a horde of these slavishly loyal rascals, the Overlord plays dirty tricks on anything that moves to become even more powerful. The gremlin-like critters will follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is. The PS3 version of this game allows you to explore and conquer 5 extra supernatural realms. Defend the Overlord's tower against waves of enemy attack with seven additional online multiplayer maps, including the competitive 'Capture the Maiden' map and 'Protect Your Power'.

Bull ride is a million times better since Rohde gave it his Caesar-esque thumbs down on the first iteration. The reason we decided to do a new add-on like Sore Spots is because you guys were up in arms about the lack of variety in the environments. Sometimes people don’t realize how much work goes into making one environment that does every mode. So instead we thought lets do two smaller ones and satisfy everyone’s need for variety.

Give it a go with friends in coop and most probably you will enjoy the game. A score between 7'2 and 7'8 seems fair to me. I'm giving it an 8 for the sake of rounding. Breakdown: If you are reading this by 2019 o later, here is what you will find in Pure Football. Technically, it is an unpolished game. Graphics are cartoonish, that helps with aging. But framerate is a bit low for this level of graphic complexity, has some blurry definition, and color palette is not the most appealing. Had the game had another 2-3 months of development, results could have been notably better in this matter. Now, if you can pass through these entry barriers, inside you will find a cool football/soccer arcade gameplay that can hook you for quite some time. Not to mention the massive potential for couch coop: up to 4 players in the same team is delirious. Just the addition of another gamer to your team will boost fun by 2x, worth trying. The game might be a bit easy, so go ahead and check hard and very hard difficulty for more challenging matches. Game has only like 20 teams including unlockables, based on national teams with a range of 8 to 12 of their best players represented (apart from Brazil that, for some licensing reason I assume, have real but not first-row players). You can also unlock classic players in story mode by fulfilling some challenges and missions. There is a player editor that lets you create some new players (not too many). Also, there is a team editor that lets you create new squads from the basic and unlocked players. You might achieve filling this teams with players from a real club, hence becoming a comprehensive entity to play against (for instance, you can create Real Madrid, since Cristiano Ronaldo, Benzema, Xabi Alonso, Luka Modric, Ramos, Pepe, Casillas and so are available in the game). Almost forgot to mention a really nice feature: custom music using the standart XMB built-in PS3 music player!

Anyways again about the game, I guess you’d call it a beat em up/platformer of sorts, and honestly, the fighting isn’t the most interesting, which bugs me, there are also these levels where you chase after things on a roadrunner, and those levels are kinda fun, the platforming itself is actually engaging, the levels and story have a lot of character in them and are enjoyable, and that’s all I really have to say",65,Mixed or average reviews,4,18,1,6.4,Mixed or average reviews,4,6,2

Okay then...Picked this up for $5 off of psn. Honestly I wasn't very impressed by the new maps. If you thought the original 3 had little variation you are going to be very unhappy with this purchase. It is just more of the same. Yes there are new enemies....but the hidden bosses are the same old 3....and the mechanics of the fighting and maps are the exact same as the others. With the exception of the giant on requiem of war (and chainsaw guy, both who can 1 hit kill you) the gameplay hasn't changed at all...you use the same techniques you did on the enemies in the first 3 maps. You will notice that there are actually less people playing these maps than the original 3...which is to be expected. The community for mercs 6 isn't exactly dead, but don't expect to find a larger community playing these 'extra' maps. It leads to frustrating wait times for pug groups unless you play at the peak hours. Go on youtube check out the videos of people playing these maps and killing these enemies....for J'avo you use the same coup de grace attacks, for zombies...countering. It's everything that was on the first 3 maps stretched super thin.....for 5$. Even if you are a hardcore mercenaries player you don't need to buy this. This was a missed opportunity for capcom. At the end of the day this is something that should of been made free to begin with. I can't give this more than a 5/10. Sorry Capcom. Potential buyers, do proper research and know what you are buying ahead of time and you will end up what you payed for. This 5/10 is a subjective rating, others will think it deserves more, others less. I can't in all good faith give this a 6 or 7 out of 10...it was a wasted opportunity, and it's not something anyone 'needs' to buy to be even a hardcore mercenaries player. The map I've had the most fun with and seems relatively popular is rooftop mission. It is a very small map, so you will be fighting next to your partner most of the time if you play duo, making for some fun gameplay components. The only new enemy on this map are the 'severely weakened' chainsaw guys....even though there is only 1 'new' enemy, you aren't missing much from the other maps.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,5,1,1

I am a huge REsident Evil fan and actually thoroughly enjoyed doing everything possible in Re6.....but this content is total crap! Do not expect to be buying a mode that is the same quality as the mercenaries. Onslaught......IF you have a mic and someone to chat with THIS mode is maybe worth the purchase. This is basically the only mode that has any kind of depth to it. Below I talk about the other multiplayer modes..skip down a section for Onslaught.******The other 3 additional pay to play modes have the shortest time limits imaginable....matches will go anywhere from 1 minute-5 minutes of actual gameplay! Literally it's like playing agent mode for 30 seconds and then mercenaries for another 30 seconds and then the game is over....you will spend as much time getting the people together and starting the game as you actually do playing the content! They put restrictions after restriction on the modes and it....it just isn't fun! The time limits are so damn short on all the other modes.********Onslaught is like Mercenaries but with some different mechanics. A game will actually last a maximum of 10 minutes if you or your competitor don't die.....which one of you most likely will 3/4 of the way in. This is the only game mode that is worth buying. The other 3 multiplayer modes and map packs are total GARBAGE! Do NOT waste your money on it. All the maps you can play on are gutted in all 4 modes....so certain sections are totally missing and blocked off. With onslaught...this is okay....with the other games? No! not okay!

I still don't know if this was due to shipping or the product itself... I was going to get it fixed at the music store a couple towns over, but never got around to it (I'm also a good example of procrastination). This time around I decided to do some more research before purchasing the guitar, but it seems the one that comes in the bundle is the best (or at least one of the best) for the price currently (Epiphone Les Paul Jr.).  I had to dig around for my old PS3 component cable, found it, left the video on HDMI and simply plugged the audio portion from the component cable directly into my stereo.  Tuning was a snap, and though during the very first lesson it felt awkward, I could tell I had made real progress by the very next day.  They say you can learn in 60 days, and right now I'm a believer.  I started before their online site was up (it's still in beta), but today it appears like a very good second screen tool to check your progress. Basically Rocksmith does for learning guitar what Mavis Beacon does for learning how to type.  It makes the learning process fun, changes it up so it doesn't get too monotonous, allows you freedom to learn what you want when you want to, provides immediate feedback and rewards. I'm not an expert yet, but the thing is I'm having enough fun for this to be a daily habit.  It's a console video game that teaches you a skill, and makes learning that skill fun enough to keep up with it over time.  I hope this coming generation sees Rocksmith continue to refine this process with their xB1 and PS4 offerings, while adding piano, drums, and vocals. Who knows, maybe even Khan Academy and Rosetta Stone could have their own console versions.  I remember ""educational"" games on the Magnavox Odyssey 2 back in the day.  They were not fun.  But the times and technologies have changed enough that I believe learning certain skills (especially musical ones) can be easy and entertaining at the same time. But back to Rocksmith 2014.  I can't find a fault in it, and maybe that's because I'm a beginner, but the thing is, it makes me want to keep that guitar in my hands every day and keep on learning new songs/techniques, so it is perfect for me.",86,Generally favorable reviews,12,2,0,8.2,Generally favorable reviews,38,10,5

The timeline for the game takes place between the movies: SAW and SAW II, giving the game its own story, yet fitting within the narratives of the movies.  The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw. Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp’s mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp’s career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw’s traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game - the likes of which he has been investigating for years - to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others. But each victim has a dark connection to Tapp. Will Tapp save them? Can he survive his obsession to find the Jigsaw killer?

If you have any interest in Suda 51's dark humour & art style as a developer, then this game will not disappoint you. Shadows of the Damned is a perfect combination of eerie & hilarious, and while graphically the game doesn't break any new ground, the game more than makes up for it with it's stylistic visuals and unorthodox gameplay elements. Not to mention, the musical score is a unique achievement all its own; which can only be described as Silent Hill meets Planet Terror. The combat, more often than not, is intense and enjoyable; and the boss battles are fun & challenging without being frustrating. My only gripe is that the controls can feel a bit clunky & sluggish at times, but not any more so than say Resident Evil 4. The one-button 180 degree turn mechanic helps remedy this to some degree, but on occasion the sprint button does feel unresponsive (and it really should have been mapped to L3 instead of R1). Again, this is a minor gripe, and it doesn't occur frequently enough to hurt the gameplay. Aside from that, the game does feel like it will probably clock in at around 10 hours. However, I'm playing on the hardest difficulty, so I'm probably looking at about 12 hours. Personally I'm okay with this. The light & dark gameplay mechanic is somewhat similar to what is found in Alan Wake (and is executed just as well), but it definitely has the Suda 51 trademark -- shooting munching goat heads as light sources, and igniting fireworks machines instead of boring flood lights. Goat heads you say? Yes... absolutely. And even the game's main character is as baffled as you. Upon discovering this, he aptly replies: ""What do I have to do to unlock a door?

If you like Singstar games in the past you'll like this, so let's talk about the dancing.That being said this is an AWESOME dancing game. I had read reviews and many of them said the dancing experience feels tacked on because you imitate the dancer on screen, there are no flash cards like other games (Kinect).That's true. However this is a plus to me. As one review said, real dancers will really like this game. Many of the routines are complex and it takes practice and multiple attempts to master. You won't breeze through with an A on the first try, but in a couple you'll get the hang and soon you'll master it.Plus, Singstar Dance's Poker Face routine slaughter's Kinect's clap-and-fist-pump routine.For people that aren't great dancers you'll still have fun and there are easier routines, but others you may not want to venture off of ""easy"" anytime soon (PCD's Don't Cha, for example).This is a great game and I'm really happy I picked it up. The reviews were too harsh but I can see their complaints, flash cards or more breakdowns would have helped. Even so, some said dancing was tacked on, a small visual in the corner...if you hit O you take up the whole screen instead of the music video, so while watching the dancer you see a large YOU in your peripheral and it helps you stay in sync.",65,Mixed or average reviews,3,17,1,3.9,Generally unfavorable reviews,3,0,5

Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I,PlayStation 3,['Sega'],Dimps Corporation,"['Action', 'General', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,12-Oct-10,"['iPhone/iPad', 'PC', 'Xbox 360']",,"It's really easy for people to immediately dismiss Sonic The Hedgehog 4. It, at first, looks like a cheap attempt by Sega to cash in on nostalgia-charmed Sonic fans under the guise of a reboot. That first impression being strengthened particularly by the fact that they've done with before with 2006's ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" and the popular opinion of Sonic as a franchise has exponentially worsened after ""Sonic Adventure 2"". Even the more appreciated 2D handheld games have been maligned by hardcore fans for lacking in terms of level design and actually well designed platform segments. So ""Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1"" has quite a lot to prove by just being a Sonic game, let alone baring direct ties to the beloved original trilogy of classic Genesis titles.Here's the cool thing, the game is great. The first thing it's easy to see that the new installment of Sonic gets right is possibly the most important to the franchise, level design. The multi-tier'd levels, containing several levels of intertwined verticality with alternate paths, containing hidden items, or speed benefits are back in full effect. Gone are the bottomless pits and poorly placed enemy's that don't give you enough time to react of the Sonic Advanced series. Each level in Sonic 4 has been painstakingly crafted in expert detail and then some; with nice little touches like the flying cards in the second act of the casino zone. I've heard people argue that the control's are bad, these people are wrong, flat out. One common point in this side of the argument is that sonic controls too slow. I can only imagine that this is coming from the somewhat prolonged time it takes Sonic to reach top speed. This point is wrong for three reasons: 1. You can tap ""A"" or ""B"" twice at all times to get a quick run, reaching top speed within fractions of a second. 2. Sonic's momentary slow pace isn't new to the series it's been there since the first game, for a very important reason. 3. The important reason being, you need that slow starting speed for the more intense platforming segments in the game to be playable. On some of the more skill-based alternate path's the platforming can get pretty intense. Imagine trying to make those precise jumps while Sonic is immediately sliding all over the place at top speed! It'd be impossible. The other common point is that the, newly added, homing attack ruins the challenge of the enemy's. Which were never challenging to begin with, since enemies in Sonic game's never really amount to more than obstacles to be rolled on or jumped over.The reality of ""Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1"", is that it's the best Sonic game in a long time. Not only that, but it can stand proud next to the best games the Series has to offer. Aside from nailing the level design and controls, it also has great music and terrific looking backgrounds. People will dismiss Sonic 4 because it's not cool to like modern Sonic games. However, those people will be missing out on one of the most stunning return's to form the gaming world has ever seen.",74,Mixed or average reviews,28,19,4,6.1,Mixed or average reviews,49,35,36

Spelunker HD,PlayStation 3,['Tozai Games'],Irem,"['Action', 'General', 'General', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,23-Nov-10,,Up to 6,"The HD graphics are fairly uninspiring, they lack the charm of games like Spelunky, Fez, Dust or La-Mulana, but they do the job and are not too offensive. A cool gimmick is that you can play the entire game using a classic visual style that replicates the garish colour palate and pixellated goodness of the NES original, complete with chiptune soundtrack. It is a wonderful addtion to be able to play the game this way, though I stuck to the updated visuals for my first playthrough. The music is also insanely catchy, original or remixed version, and will stick in your head for days to come. Much like the absolutely awesome Spelunky, Spelunker HD dumps your little explorer in a cavernous environment filled with danger. The caves you explore are completely different from those seen in the original games, so seasoned experts of those games will have a whole new world to explore. The usual assortment of cave dwelling critters are out to get you, as well as some unusual choices such as hopping lizard things and swooping birds (I didn't realise eagles lived in caves). As well as living beasts, you also have to contend with the undead. A ghost will appear every now and then, signified by the music changing to a spooky melody, and will float towards you from a random side of the screen. To temporarily banish him you must use your hand fan (yes, really) to blow him away. It looks more like the Ghostbusters' proton pack so let's pretend it's one of those as that is far cooler. The ghost can come in different sizes, taking longer to evaporate in massive form, and can also split into multiple smaller ghosts. Needless to say he is a pain in the hole. If you have played Spelunky then you will be familiar with the concept (and if you haven't then I demand you stop reading this and go do so immediately), but Spelunker on NES did it first. You also have limited oxygen, which depletes at a steady rate, and can only be topped up by collecting energy items. These are positioned fairly regularly so as long as you don't hang around too long you should be OK. Bombs and flares can also be collected, the former for blasting away rocks that block your path, or secret walls, and the latter for firing into the air to scare away  bats, and the irritating swooping birds. Keys are the most important pickup as each coloured key unlocks the corresponding door, and finding them all is mandatory. The end level checkpoint, a golden statue, is locked behind multiple doors and so you will have to explore every inch of each stage to locate the required keys. Thankfully the stages, while large, aren't too confusing, and if you do get a little lost, there is always the minimap at the bottom right of the screen to assist you. Your worst enemy in Spelunker HD is actually yourself, more precisely your jump. Yes, the irritating cheap deaths of the original remain here and sure, I died many times after slipping off an edge or jumping from too great a height, and it was annoying, but it is much easier on you than the 80's classic. There is a handy rope assist option that means you cannot fall from ropes by accidentally holding left or right while climbing (believe me, in the original this happened a lot!). So you make your way through the caves, collecting keys, avoiding enemies, steaming holes, pitfalls, rolling boulders, cascading water and more, trying to locate the statue. After 10 levels you finish the area and move onto another, with a different backdrop and new enemies. It is always exciting to reach a new set of stages, complete with new hazards and enemies out for your blood. Spelunker constantly throws surprises at you throughout its entirety, and you really get the feeling that you are descending into the unknown. Spelunker HD is a damn enjoyable game. Once you get used to the limitations set by the game and don't jump off ladders and platforms willy-nilly, as comes naturally after years of playing more forgiving platformers, you can engross yourself in the depths and really start to enjoy the exploration. In fact I can safely say it is one of the most playable platformers I have experienced for a long time. I came to Spelunker HD expecting the worst, but was absolutely blown away by how enjoyable it is and, equally, baffled by why it has receieved such negative press. I strongly urge you to ignore all these misguided reviews you have read and purchase it immediately. If you love it as much as I do then feel free to comment here  shower me with gifts.",56,Mixed or average reviews,4,8,5,7.7,Generally favorable reviews,5,1,1

It's not easy to end a mission. (1)you must push select, (2)find the galactic map with R1/L1, and (3)find the new option which appears at the bottom of the screen. Wouah, not very intuitive...[Selection Screens (Map, equipment, statistics...)]. Not easy (again) to use a double navigation. R1/L1 for principal menu and ""arrows"" for secondary menu. But you just need a little practice...[Videos scenes between primary missions]. It's only drawings that move...and some drawings are very, VERY Ugly...[Others]. Nobody says that only primary missions are important for the score (1A, 2A, 3A,...) all the other are useful only to have credits. Sometime, you really don't kown where are these bloody containers or the exit. You are forced to search every inch of the level. Only ten primary mission, and thirty in whole... and when you finish game, you can't start again a choosen mission. For me this is the only very bad aspect (and you are not launched by an capital starship and you don't have to land)THE GOOD :Well, fortunately fights and graphics in mission are good.Manoeuvrability is good and you have a great precision. It's rare on ps3 where you can be an pilot in space as in StarWars, Galactica or Macross(Robotech).I found the excitment i had when i played (long years ago) at Elite on C64 or Tie Fighter on PC.You have three forms SpaceShip for dogfight, and you can switch (in the same mission) with a GerWalk form (or Guardian in Robotech) or a Turret form (a static postion). You can upgrade your ship (but i never find how to change my starship's coque), for munitions you have a satellite to refit, and if you explose you'll be resurected in 5-10 seconds.And if you waste too much time in an mission you can redo it immediatly.DIFFICULTIES :[Commands]. You don't have the SAME commands when you switch forms This need some training. Sometimes it's VERY hard to switch because you don't activate the good form and you scratch on an rock face. Find the good weapons, can became a real difficulty. For instance To neutralize a capitalShip you need the heavy weapon of the turret but to clean the space arround the capitalShip you need to fight with the light weapon of the spaceship form....[Missions] they are repetitive. There are lot of mission with only Dogfight and some to destroy capitalship, go inside asteroids, find weapons in an artificial satellite, erase a starbase... Well, you are a pilot, you want -above all- have dogfights, no ?For a PSN game, i think it's a good game.In resume 7/10 because Cheap, pleasure to pilot, but with a weird ergonomic, some difficulties and no possibilities to redo missions done.",0,No score yet,0,0,3,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,1

There is an assumption of how arcade baseball games control that has been passed down from RBI Baseball on the NES that Super Mega Baseball said we can do it better.  It takes a veteran of arcade baseball games like Baseball Stars some getting used to but once the controls click it is sublime.  The 100 levels of difficulty (yes 100 levels of difficulty) is both a pro and con.  Pro is that it scales from automatically from doing everything for you to minute control of everything that is actually more complicated than Sony's The Show.  Great if you want to play your 6 year old daughter so each of you can have a different level and play each other.  The con is that the difficultly level is arbitrary and it will take some experimenting to find the right level and you can't do things like set the field to manual and the hitting to auto assist.  The looks are cartoony and OK but it really needs a MLB license.  You can progress a career mode and do lots of customization but it will still never make it as fun as striking out A-Rod virtually.

It's not a perfect game, by any means, but as a Spider-Man game, it succeeds in nearly every respect. It far surpasses its predecessor by building on its mechanics, adding more varied side missions, having a more coherent, almost ""classic"" Spider-Man narrative. The game ditches the concept of nearly every enemy being a robot, and clearly, this is for the best. The added Peter Parker sections, while nothing groundbreaking, do help break up the pace, and give fans what they've wanted in a Spider-Man game for a long time now; more focus on Parker himself. The combat and stealth mechanics are nearly the same as they were in the previous game, which is serviceable and works well. However, this time around there's no button to press to simply escape everything trying to kill you, and this is a replaced with a well implemented system of Spider-Man using his (or the player's) own wits to escape and ""web up"" his wounds. While added animations to this mechanic would have helped immensely, it's still greatly appreciated that it's there, and that the regenerating health system has been axed. The pace of the game and the natural progression of missions works well, all considered. Given your time in Manhattan, you're given side missions to partake in to add to your ""hero"" meter. If you neglect these side missions, then the meter will start to fall into the ""menace"" segment, and you'll be chased by officials hired by Oscorp to take out vigilantes, I.E., Spider-Man. It's not an amazing or groundbreaking mechanic by itself, yet considering it rises and falls as quickly as it does, it does make for a game that moves at a breakneck pace, regardless of doing the same 5 side missions over and over. Most side missions have just enough variation to them that it doesn't become a problem. The idea of using different Spidey suits for different effects to the character works very well. Each suit has its own, independent level meter, which you can choose to level up by beating up thugs and the like at any time. The suits have different effects, ranging from damage increases to stickier webbing, and it's a nice addition that is bound to suit anyone's play style. One more thing worth noting is the web swinging mechanics. They're greatly improved in this game compared to its predecessor. Gone are the days of Spidey's webs sticking to thin air. This time around, you have to attach your webs to buildings throughout the city. While it's more of a visual effect than a fully realized mechanic, as seen in Ultimate Spider-Man, the game still tries to retain the same feel, and it's successful in doing so. Web slinging and zipping around the city feels freeing and exhilarating, and I can't stress how much of an improvement it is in comparison to the last game. The visuals, at least on PS3, fare very well. Draw distance is long, the lighting effects look great, character models (though sometimes overused) are detailed, and Spidey himself, along with the main villains and main characters, look wonderful. Overall, there's not too much to complain about on the visual side of things. However, the game is not without its bugs (pun intended, of course). There are some clipping issues here and there, and sometimes Spidey will float in thin air in the middle of a fist fight. This doesn't break the game, by any means, but the random freezes do. They don't happen that often, but when things seem to get too hectic, the game will just lock up. So far, it's only happened to me once within hours upon hours of play, but it's something worth noting. All in all, this is an awesome Spidey game. I truly think it's the best Spidey game to release since Ultimate Spider-Man, which, for the record, I think is a far superior game to Spider-Man 2, speaking objectively. Granted, none of these games reach the awesome factor of Maximum Carnage or Spider-Man vs. Kingpin, but I have to say, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 comes close. I sincerely don't understand all the negativity toward this game. Absolutely everything from its predecessor was improved, and the game is fast paced and is extremely fun to play.

The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,['NIS America'],Nippon Ichi Software,"['Role-Playing', 'General', 'Roguelike']",T,17-Mar-15,,,"- The Game - I think that the first thing that should be said about a game, is what kind of product it is, in order to solve the first question any buyer has when he is buying a new game.The Awakened Fate is a typical dungeon crawler, which means that it is based on the exploration of a series of labyrinth where enemies and weapons became more powerful as the game progress. - The Story - The story is focused around the war between two opposite factions: angels and devils. In this context Shin Kamikaze, a human, get killed by some demons because he possess the right constitution to receive the power of the Fate Awakened Crystal, a gem that the angels want to use to turn a human into a powerful being that will fight for them in the war.After being rescued by the angels, he joins them, and with the support of the two co-protagonists of the game: the angel Jupiel and the demon Ariel, he will start to fight. I believe that the strong point of this game is the story, I warn you, that it follow a very ""japanese"" way of storytelling ( that you can like or dislike ), which blend together scenes from the daily routine of the different protagonists ( sometimes useless to the main story, but very interesting if you like to follow the development of the characters ) and serius/dramatic moments.If you like this kind of stories I belive that you will appreciate very much this game. From time to time, during the story, the protagonist will receive the task to choice how he want to change ""fate"": in terms of gameplay it means that the player will have to select between two given choice, how he want to perform certain actions, in my opinion this is a great feature and even after finishing the game, it will be worthy to start again from the beginning just to see what would had happened if you had selected different choices.Not always things will turn out the way we wanted, but I think that it should be obvious, since we are selecting just what ""the protagonist want to do"" and not what ""will absolutely happen"". In a certain sense after sometimes you'll really ""feel"" the pressure of the choice you are making ( it's important to note that sometimes the game become very cruel out of the blue, and even if it is just in the form of textuals descripcions some outcomes are very unpleasant ). - Graphic - In my opinion there are some games that don't need to push to the extreme the possibilities of a console, instead they just have to fit to style of the game.This is one of those cases, the graphic isn't very great, but it suit well with the story. The exploration of the labyrinth uses a low poly 3D graphic with bright colours, simple but very unique. When the story goes on, instead we have 2D drawing in japanese style of very good quality. - Recap - This is a very interesting game, with the right difficult to allow newcomers to enjoy it, and a storytelling able to satisfy many fans of j-rpg.The post-game contents are few and somewhat easy, so after the ending there would not be very much things to do, but the feature of the ""choices"" definitely leave the appeal to try to start again one or two times the game just to see what would have happened in different situations. However it's important to keep in mind that the game is not a masterpiece ( and neither tries to be one ), but anyway it does well its job to entertain during the time you'll need to finish it.",65,Mixed or average reviews,4,14,2,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,18,2,6

From the early touring days in 1963 Liverpool to the immortal, final performance on the Apple Corps rooftop, fans can follow in the band’s footsteps as they traverse the globe during the height of Beatlemania. Adding to the experience is the introduction of three-part vocal harmonies to game play, allowing gamers to revel in the unparalleled vocal stylings of the Fab Four. Beatles fans will also be thrilled to hear previously unreleased authentic voice recordings from John, Paul, George and Ringo chatting between takes during studio sessions recorded at Abbey Road more than four decades ago. The game begins during the band's earliest days at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, England. Gamers then travel across the Atlantic to experience the band's unforgettable 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the sold-out concert at New York’s Shea Stadium in 1965, and conclude at The Beatles’ memorable concert at Budokan in Tokyo, Japan in 1966. The Beatles' studio years come to life in legendary Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios. Highlighting the studio years are inspired artistic visual expressions known as Dreamscapes, intended to transport players to imaginative environments that capture the essence of The Beatles’ genre-busting musical and fashion transformations during their later years. The game follows The Beatles to 1969 where story mode culminates with their final performance on the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters. The Beatles: Rock Band offers a new set of hardware representing the instruments made famous by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Featured in the set are the Rickenbacker 325 and Gretsch Duo Jet guitars - hailed as two of the celebrated, signature instruments played by John Lennon and George Harrison throughout their careers. Also included is a Höfner bass controller - a large-scale version of the bass famously used by Sir Paul McCartney. Rounding out the set is a Ringo Starr inspired, Ludwig-branded Rock Band 2 drum set with a classic pearl finish and vintage remake of a Beatles kick drum head.

The Guided Fate Paradox,PlayStation 3,['NIS America'],Nippon Ichi Software,"['Role-Playing', 'General', 'General', 'Roguelike']",T,5-Nov-13,,No Online Multiplayer,"I'm honestly not sure why so many people think that this game is difficult.  It's a fairly easy roguelike game considering that you can actually grind in order to get stronger unlike most. I also noticed that several people mentioned that the stat boosts you get when leveling in the dungeons doesn't affect much, which is definitely false.  Level 1 when you first start the game verses the end of the game is a HUGE difference.  By the end, my total level was 689 and even without my normal gear my main ATK and DEF stats were 315 and 216 respectively. The base stats were 135 and 130, so that's over a 2x increase for ATK and almost 2x for DEF.  It definitely makes things easier. Getting more into the game, the story, character development and gameplay are all superb.  This RPG actually had one of the most likeable protagonists I've ever encountered, and the development of both the main protagonist and Lilliel (his assistant) are fantastic.  The story slowly unfolds and is much deeper than originally shown, which ends up being on of the most memorable video game stories in a long time. The graphics are pretty awesome as well.  The sprite art is well detailed all around and transitions between combat and events pretty well.  The voice acting and SFX are pretty solid as well.  Nothing ground breaking, but it was all good. My main gripe with the game is that the middle chapters can feel pretty long.  Not very much goes on besides some sprinkles of story.  They probably could have cut out two or three chapters and it would have been more enjoyable in my opinion. Ratings are as follows: Story 4.5/5Graphics 5/5Gameplay 5/5Sound 4/5 So, overall I give it a 4.5/5.  Great gameplay and story, although a little drawn out, but definitely a great time.

The ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Collection,PlayStation 3,['SCEA'],Bluepoint Games,"['Miscellaneous', 'Action Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Compilation', 'Compilation']",T,27-Sep-11,,No Online Multiplayer,"Let me start by stating the facts: not everyone will understand these games, not everyone will enjoy them, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Certain people can't watch a movie unless it has explosions, certain people can't watch Public Television because it educates rather than entertains, and certain people will pick this up on the recommendation of another and feel 100% cheated because it doesn't involve wanton killing, busty women, rampant foul language and guns.If you are one of these types of people, it's okay.  I'm not going to judge you or your tastes.  I'll just let you know that i feel sorry for you, because whatever ""eye of the beholder"" thing it takes to truly enjoy these games, you don't have it, and believe me, your life is worse because of that.  You don't know what you've missed.Ico is definitely the harder game to get into, out of the two games in the collection. It will involve you solving puzzles and leading a girl to safety by escaping the castle where the both of you are imprisoned.  It will involve her speaking in a language you don't understand, and it will tax the part of the brain that won't help you fire a gun.  For those patient enough to brave the journey, you may find yourself with an incredibly emotional experience at the end of the road, and you'll be amazed a video game could make you feel that way.   I'm trying to spoil as little as I can for you, and I'm sorry if this sounds a bit paltry, but this is the gist of the experience.On the other hand, Shadow Of The Colossus is the most beautifully haunting game I've ever played.  It too is about solving puzzles, but the goal in this game is not to figure out how you'll escape a castle, it's how to kill sixteen giant beasts that dwarf you in scale.  No other game has made me feel so overwhelmingly powerful by making me feel so insignificant throughout the entire process - the expansive overworld with no enemies or even epic travel music, the loneliness between your character and the horse he rides, it all seems so pointless until you find your next enemy.  The silence is the calm before the storm, and that storm is the next giant beast you will have to locate, climb and somehow kill.  It will give you a sense of wonder, dread and most of all, it will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that video games deserve to be called an artistic medium. As I said, it won't be for everyone.  But if you find yourself looking for something that could make you proud to own your PlayStation, and you don't mind not shooting a gun or scoring a goal, then you may find yourself in for the best games that the previous generation had to offer.  There's a very good reason why the PlayStation 2 was the home of the best franchise titles of the last hardware generation, and that didn't have as much to to with Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil, Madden, Final Fantasy or God Of War as it did games like Ico and Shadow Of The Colossus.  Now, these games have been given a 1080p HD facelift, and given trophies for the player to earn as well.  Any individual who considers themselves a gamer, in any sense of the term whether broad or niche, needs to try these two games.  You may find that you don't like them, and like I said earlier, that's okay.  Caviar isn't for everyone, and one man's delicacy can be another's poison.  If you're in the mood for something besides controller McDonalds, though, this is your wake-up call.For those who do pick it up and find themselves lost in the most incredible worlds, your curiosity will be rewarded hundredfold.  Then, you'll understand why people like myself are so excited for The Last Guardian...and chances are, you will be too after playing through these two games (and especially SotC).

I played a lot of real pinball in my youth, and I've played a number of these tables in real life.  While I can't say that the tables are ""perfect"" (who could), I feel that this is an excellent representation of pinball.  With a pinball sim it's all about ball physics, and TPA seems to get this right.  The balls seem to have the right weight and feel on the flippers, and my rudimentary set of pinball flipper moves work just fine. My only issues with this game are DLC related.  The base game gives you 4 tables for $9.99, which isn't a bad deal at all, considering that these tables are complex and each represents many hours of gameplay to master them (if that's really possible - I've been playing pinball for years and I've only ever progressed to being perhaps slightly above mediocre). Beyond the original 4 tables you can buy individual tables for anywhere from $4.99 - $7.99, which some double table packs in the same range;  or you can choose an entire ""season"" for $29.99, or $39.99 for the ""pro pack"", which I think allows you to tinker with the tables' settings more.  There are several seasons available, and each seems to contain 15-20 tables.  Now, that's a LOT of content for $30, but still, I don't like the $10 bump to get the pro pack - partly because I don't know if I really need/want the pro features, or not. So, as you can see, a $10 game can become very expensive very quickly if you desire to increase your collection of tables.  But then again, $30 for 15+ tables isn't a bad deal at all if you think about it. I guess what I want is for more pack variations (half season?  I don't know) and for them to ditch the regular vs. pro packages, and just have it so that if you buy a table you get all the features for that table. However, this is a great game.  It's fun to sit and learn a table (and many are very complicated) and see your scores improve.  If you care about pinball, this is a great game.",0,No score yet,2,1,0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,3,0,1

The Surfer,PlayStation 3,['Bungarra Software Pty Ltd'],Bungarra Software Pty Ltd,"['Sports', 'Individual', 'Surf / Wakeboard']",E,13-Dec-17,['PC'],No Online Multiplayer,"Heaps better than I thought it was going to be. The control feels weird and a bit clunky (at first) but after a while it feels really good, just like surfing. The pump and combo control is addictive, so they did a good job there and you can tell they put a lot of thought into that. Some of the commentary is a bit repetitive and annoying, and so are the character voices but you can turn then off. I liked the way they made it feel like a WSL TV presentation in the main game, that was really good. More like the sport. Graphics are ok, nothing to write home about but for a PS3 game they are acceptable - 720p so it would have been nicer at 1080p. When I run it up against my old Kelly Slater and Transworld Surf on PS2 then you can see it holds its own. It's actually better gameplay in a lot of ways. The jetski is a bit novel and I liked the way you get to drive and pull the surfer into the wave. Haven't seen that before, so that was cool. I liked having to manage my surfboards and they snap so that was also different. Split screen was nice but no online so far, so that's a bummer. DLC is coming so if they do it then that'd be good. In all, surfers should like it but its really niche and if you don't surf then it probably won't appeal.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,2,0,0

It also didn't surprise me that this game received a very ordinary score from critics, because the series has a history of rather poor voice acting (with the exception of Holmes & Watson) and being quite poorly animated with quite low frame rates.  These low frame rates also make some NPCs look really ridiculous on screen.  However, the game's strengths are in the story and the puzzles.  Along with The Awakened and Sherlock Holmes Vs Jack The Ripper, this game has a very dark story.  One in which Sherlock Holmes might actually be behind something terrible, and Watson is torn between loyalty and justice.  It's writing and narrative is of a great quality in this sense, and there is great building of tension in it as it progresses.  The puzzles are exactly what you expect from previous titles in the series, as you need to search everywhere for clues and make deductions as to what has taken place.  Some of these puzzles are more difficult than others, and the easy version of this game allows players to simply skip difficult puzzles and enjoy the story.  The music in this game is great, capable of creating the right mood for the scenario.  The gameplay, though chunky, is very workable.  And the graphics, despite the poor animation, are about the same as early PS3 & 360 titles.  The background design is beautifully done with all of the grit and grime of whitechapel and the mill, as well as the lovely victorian design of Baker Street and various other high-end locations that Holmes and Watson visit during their investigation.  If you have kids who are fans of Sherlock Holmes as well as video games, wait until they are at least teenagers before letting them play this game, because it does contain some disturbing imagery.  Overall, an 8.  It is a fun game, but it isn't trying to please the biggest demographic.  It has its own audience, and it had the advantages of taking risks were bigger titled games wouldn't go.",65,Mixed or average reviews,1,15,0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,19,17,2

I really felt I had to do everything in my power to keep Clementine alive here, and that kept me very invested. However there is one key issue I found with this episode, and unlike in the previous episodes the issue isn't with a lack of gameplay. The issue I have here is that I don't really care about this new cast anywhere near as much as the old one. The only characters whose fates I actually really care about, are the ones who return from the first season. That made it hard for me to care if the majority of these new characters died, and therefore took out some of the emotion this episode could have otherwise had for me. That's not to say that I dislike the new characters, it's just that the majority of them I don't find as enjoyable as the previous season's. That being said this episode did make a few of them grow on me, so it may be only a matter of time until I like them. Overall I found this to be the best episode this season has had yet. It's tense, made me question my decisions and who to trust, and there's some actual gameplay here. Here's hoping that the last two episodes continue the upward trend. As of right now I am more excited then ever for the next episode of this season, and if they can make me care about at least the majority of the new cast in the next episode, then maybe my disappointment so far with this season will change.

It's basically just a crappy add-on to a crappy game. If you actually liked Survival Instinct than this DLC might be of some worth to you. I doubt it, but it might. It adds a new game mode and gives you some new weapons to use in the campaign. The main problem with this DLC is that Survival Instinct itself isn't any fun to play. The biggest part of this add-on is the new mode called ""Herd Mode"". It puts you up against endless waves of zombies. As you progress through the waves of zombies the map gets bigger by opening up new areas. Supplies like ammo and health items are scattered around the map for you to use. It all sounds pretty decent, but fails thanks to the irritating combat that plagues the game and because you can't play with a friend. The sole reason theses modes have ever had any success is because playing them with your friends is so much fun. Take that out and all your left with is the hope that the combat system is fun enough to make players see a reason to play it on their own. In the case of this game it isn't. Combat in this game is tedious, so this new mode is basically worthless. Even if you enjoyed the main game this DLC I can't recommend this at all. The new game mode sucks and playing with a few new weapons isn't worth suffering through the story mode again. It's not worth wasting your money on. I'm a little shocked that they even bothered to release a add-on for this game. All I can say is don't buy this.

After beating the game I have to say that after the first battle this game becomes incredibly easy to play and beat because you figured out how to predict your enemies next attacks.  Sure it may be hard for some people, but because chess is hard for some people that doesn't mean it is a terrible game.  I enjoyed this game a lot, and I think that the things that can be improved upon are dramatically outweighed by the fact that the developers went out of their way to create a game that is fun and exciting. Another concern people have about this game is that there are not really any tutorials, and since I never have enjoyed tutorial sections in games before and always skip them when I can this is a welcome relief.

The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons.

A couple of game renditions were made with their ""starring"", see arcade / andarcade success / 18 Wheelers, less successful sequel to King of Route 66, or mission-based Big Mutha Truck I.-II. As far as I can remember, there was another fairly fair racing truck based racing game on PS2. In 2014, Bigben Studio found it good to try multiplatform title gamma. Well, I think it was a pity .... Why? Let's see ... The game had a lot of different game modes to choose from, from the anno / championship,time-trial,etc./, truck, the selection is quite nice. In the tradition of well-established car gamers, we can buy parts to improve and improve the properties of our ""rubber duck"". No problem with these ... What's that? Anyone who has an anno to the game / or is having a retouch now / will be confronted with it immediately after loading the game, why am I disappointed. On the one hand, the graphics are not new in the design of the vehicles, the track and its surroundings. And the gameplay and control is the capitalization of the FALSE. The big irons don't feel their weight, they roll around like a bottle of pills in a spring / autumn breeze. There is a fracture model, but the nice player does not throw a backhand. We have seen a much nicer, more detailed ""injury modeling"". In terms of sound effects, it is possible to say that the TR reaches the ""go with soda"" level. But the gameplay ... that damn gameplay ... Let's start by saying that we can boost our ""boost"" as a fuzzy idea / because we can charge it during collisions. This is strange to me already, as it would not be the essence of a car race on a lane, indeed. But what AI is doing is subdued. Stupid, panties, all rivals are keen to kick us out of the field or to get us into the barrier / gravel bed surrounding the track. Each of these collisions is so tumultuous that Kovi's adult, gangbang scenes could not have seen the adult audience similar. In addition, thanks to the monsters screaming at the base of the big smoke clouds, you can't see anything in the sky. Neither your own vehicle nor the route guidance would be where you would be ahead. So, if you still have a fellow heron who wants to nostalgic, avoid this ""gem"" by far. It's better if you visit your family / sweetheart / buddy for the Trucking Championships at Hungaroring. Overall, my Truck Racer is worth a fraction of 3 points. **** if you want to do good for yourself, stay with Eurotruck2 ....",0,No score yet,0,0,0,3.6,Generally unfavorable reviews,1,1,5

For the most part, yes, you mostly climb stuff, and stare at the beautiful scenery that Naughty Dog has masterfully produced. The irony is that even though Uncharted is a platformer, not a shooter, it actually has more responsive and in depth shooting and combat mechanics than anything else on the market. However, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. Log into the multiplayer, and you're in for the time of your life. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves contains one of the most well designed multiplayer modes available today. Yes, it is greater than anything that the ""all-powerful"" Xbox Live has to offer. With 10 players, in beautiful maps, you can partake in many of the typical multiplayer modes. The most impressive parts of the multiplayer are the facts that the maps aren't FLAT like in COD or Halo. Victory in the multiplayer relies upon the players' skill levels, not how long they've played or how many expansions that they had purchased, as in other shooters. This is no doubt one of the most complete packages that has been offered this generation. The only drawback is the repetitive single player mode, but that is soon forgotten as you step onto one of the most active online multiplayers on the PS3.

This actively avoids having you kill anyone, instead knocking them out with a punch upside the head. You throw grenades at times, but the enemy runs before they explode. You may feel like they are babying you, keeping the horrors away, but if you look around your characters, the horror is all around you: you don't need to add to it when the screen fills up with the dead and dying. When your actions are directly responsible for a person's death, it is shown exactly as it should be shown - a horrific act that you would regret, not celebrate; something unforgettable rather than a bloodless body-count racking up on a screen. As you play, the puzzles don't change too much in difficulty, but the feeling of helplessness ramps up, as everything you do seems to feel less and less like a victory. That's the point. That's what the war felt like to many. And if that ending doesn't move you to tears, I feel that you really didn't give the attention to the message this game was telling you. This is not a game for kids.

The game follows an original story where the last surviving group that tried to fight against the creature known as Orochi travels back in time to prevent their bad future from happening. It is a dramatic turn from the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors games that have redesigned the same maps and battles over and over again. In this one, there are even some modern environments. Each of the 140+ characters have different move sets and different abilities to use. The only problem is that it can take quite a long time to max out a character because you have to level them up to 100 multiple times to ensure that they have max stats. One of the things I liked a lot about the game is the weapon customization. You can fuse weapons together and transfer their abilities to one another, giving a weapon properties like extended reach, bonus damage against officers, or recover health when using certain attacks. I found this very useful because it could make even the most worthless of characters tolerable. The only problem I have with the battles is that you have to play them out as they are scripted. You often cannot take shortcuts like rushing the boss because you have to open a path to them.

When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion – a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers – Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity . . . but who is watching the Watchmen? [Warner Bros. Interactive]",54,Mixed or average reviews,2,21,7,6.8,Mixed or average reviews,8,3,5

It's actually pretty unique because you have to push the correct buttons to the rhym of snoop dogg/lion's hip hop hits (not reggae) to fight opponents in a bizarre and dumb storyline. There are 19 levels in the game and their is some repetition in the enemies you brawl but its not bad and some of the choreographed fights are pretty cool to watch. The game is a straight up rhym game though so if you don't like those kinda games look elsewhere(if anyone else even buys it) it is also pretty cheap equivalent to or less than a cd at a music store (though it is rated t and most of the words are edited out (why?) if you like rap or snoop dogg/lion you will like this just don't expect too much from it",0,No score yet,0,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,0,0

You Don't Know Jack,PlayStation 3,['THQ'],"Jellyvision, Iron Galaxy Studios","['Miscellaneous', 'Trivia / Game Show', 'Trivia / Game Show']",T,8-Feb-11,"['iPhone/iPad', 'PC', 'Xbox 360']",Up to 4,"I was very hesitant to get this game, and wouldn't have if I wasn't stuck at home for three weeks. Owning nearly all of the previous YDKJ games on the PC, I've always been a huge fan, and it was the game of choice in my dorm room with friends. Upon hearing of a console release with a four-player limit, episodic format (which I remember from The Ride), and some altered mechanics to make things more fair, I had a very good feeling for this version. However, I was turned off hardcore upon discovering that the Jack Attack was based on the flash version of the game (Huh?) and that there were no gibberish questions, one of my favorite things in the previous games. I can understand not having gibberish questions in a console game, since there's no keyboard, and typing in answers would take forever, and I'll let that slide. So let's run down the list of things that are important here. One, the episodic format, which you likely remember from The Ride more than anything else, is *not* based on themes. In The Ride, every ""episode"" had a certain theme, like alcohol, or the government, or celebrities, or something like that. It wasn't a perfect system because right off the bat you'd know who'd have the advantage in the episode. For instance, if the episode was about computers, and one of you is a computer technician while another is a political science major with little computer experience, you know right away who's going to win. So, while this is avoided since each episode has no specific theme, it's still misleading to call these things ""episodes"" when the questions have virtually no connection. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is the way questions are answered, which is vastly different from any other YDKJ game. First of all, all players can answer, rather than a single player buzzing in and earning the prize. It's conceivable that every single person can get the answer right, and there is no special bonus for being the first to answer. Instead, how much money you get from a question isn't based on the question itself; all questions are worth an equal amount of money (doubled in round two), and the amount you get decreases as the clock runs down. It's very simple: If you buzz in with 14 seconds left, you get $1400, or $2800 if it's round two. Buzz in with two seconds left, and you get $200. All multiple-choice questions have an identical value, sans special rounds. This system actually tends to work, especially for wireless controllers, because if only one person buzzed in and answered, that person might just have the advantage of being closer to the TV, or being wired. It's arguably a nice new mechanic that helps ease the game along. The Dis-Or-Dats have also been changed somewhat. In previous versions, there was nothing complicated about them: You had two or three choices for each word or phrase, and you picked the right one to earn money, or picked the wrong one to lose it. This version makes things a little more complicated. First, the amount of money you earn is largely based on how quickly you can answer all the items correctly, and the time left afterward is a bonus in addition to the regular value of the items. The second thing is that other players no longer totally sit out in this round, and now have a role to play. If the main player of the Dis-Or-Dat gets an item wrong, and other players buzz in the correct answer *before* the main player answers, they will all share the money earned, which is considered a ""steal"". It's great that there is now an opportunity for other players to join in the Dis-Or-Dats, rather than having all but one player sit out completely.However, not everything here is perfect. Let's just get this out of the way: the flash version of the Jack Attack just isn't as good as the ones that came before it. In fact, it seemed like the Jack Attacks got progressively worse as time went on, and were made less and less intense. And here, we have, in my opinion, the least likable Jack Attack created. It's very busy, not particularly tension-building, and just noisy, but not in a good way. I would have vastly preferred an earlier version of the Jack Attack, maybe even the original, or The Ride. There's also one other really, really huge problem with the Jack Attack: Whereas most games before this one had answers worth $2k each, this one does them at an unreal $4k each, which is simply not right. Keep in mind that questions are all fixed in value, and all things considered, $4k is an obscene amount of money. You can understand, then, that you can absolutely suck at the main game, but come back and win in the Jack Attack. At some point, you just have to draw the line on how much of a game-breaker a Jack Attack can be. One unlucky category and all your hard work goes down the drain. So, some things are lacking, and some things work. Is it worth it? Sure.",82,Generally favorable reviews,10,1,0,8.2,Generally favorable reviews,14,2,1

It is true the game can be relentless at the opening but every game you duel you win at least one card and sometimes up to 10 or more cards so you are always building a library to overcome this challenge, it is not like you are stuck. In my opinion, I like this, if the game was too easy it would be boring and this difficulty does nothing more than peek my interest in the game and the decks that are available to be built with custom cards you win. As you play more your options increase as to what kind of decks you can make. Actually there is very little wrong with this game. I can only find annoyance in the background music which can be toggled down and I also think they could have cleaned up the card library interfaces, but they are usuable without too much concern. All said I can't see why so many upset players, you are allowed 5 deck slots for variety of play, there is online matchmaking and ranked games with variable customization in rules, you always win cards and the difficulty of the game is random and variable depending on your opponent. Unlike magic the gathering on ps3 which is made to be a tutortial essentially this game is complete and does not top out in deckbuilding. The more you play the larger your library without capping what the player can win and be stuck with. This game costs $10 which is less than an introductory set of physical cards you could buy in a store and then have to find a person or friend to play with. I just can't understand why someone would rate this game low when it essentially is a virtual collection of winnable cards that can be customized to be played online against players anywhere in the world without caps and has a challenging AI computer system......For $10 this game has to receive a 9 score from me.
