It makes the experience feel... special, somehow. Intimate. I'm no graphics whore, but this game is freakin' beautiful. And it's fun, once you get used to it's little quirks. As a side scroller, it doesn't hold up to the fluidity of a Shadow Complex or Mark of the Ninja, but by the same token, one could say that DMC4 isn't as fluid as ninja theory's DMC reboot, or that Virtua Fighter isn't as smooth as Blazblue, or that FFTactics isn't as smooth as XCom. In reality, they're just different.

Set on planet BG-386; a human colonist mining group discovers an ancient pyramid containing a dark and horrible secret. Across the galaxy, a race of warriors is alerted to the discovery of their pyramid and a hunting party is dispatched to ensure that it remains sealed at all costs. Deep inside the ruined pyramid meanwhile, nature's deadliest species awakes from centuries of hibernation intent on finding new prey. The Colonial Marine's story is an incredible fight against all odds from horrors lurking in the dark. Surrounded on all sides yet armed to the teeth, the Colonial Marine represents humanity's last stand with the firepower to fight back. As the Alien, players discover what it's like to be the scariest, most murderous creature in the universe, with the ability to traverse any surface at lightning speed in order to get close enough to unleash its deadly claws, tail and teeth. A master of the hunt, the Predator grants the player an arsenal of exotic weaponry with which to stalk from the shadows. Earn the greatest honor by ambushing prey up-close, before butchering them for a gory trophy kill. [Sega]",64,Mixed or average reviews,16,45,3,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,148,75,37

Capcom is the first, and hopefully the last. It's insane to think that a company can essentially rip out a significant moment in a game just to make a quick buck off of it and still get away with it. I don't believe that people should purchase this. That would only further support the terrible practices of Capcom. Rather, I'd recommend watching the ending online.

You play as both teen ben and young ben, for the most part each can turn into all alien forms, with only a handful of exclusives that the others can’t.There are 13 alien forms total all with their own feel to them and special abilities that can be used to help with level progression.The levels in omniverse are pretty dull and boring though.Honestly, no 2 levels look any different or play any different.Every level is a linear grind of defeating wave of enemy after wave of enemy, and the variety of aliens isn’t enough to make playthroughs feel any different.You basically switch through the aliens until you find the one you like, upgrade it and stick with it throughout the game.Omniverse was made with little no care, the developers were out to make a game with as little effort as humanly possible, published by D3, I honestly didn’t expect more from the beginning, all they do is publish lazy games.This game is a God of War rip off down to the boss fights.All boss battles are open, not forcing a 3 stage pattern which is great, and end in an epic God of War style quick time event.Even enemies drop orbs and there are canisters that act as chests that are filled with orbs, and shakes and gems to upgrade health and energy.You’ll find yourself climbing walls and doing super easy puzzles, all which are nearly identical across all 10 levels.Luckily the levels are paced perfectly for such a repetitive style, making the game at least a little bit fun.Levels are massively short, not many lasting for more than 20 minutes.It took me about 3 and a half hours to beat the game in its entirety, and that includes trophy hunting.Where the game is different from god of war though is that it includes local co-op.You have an ai controlled buddy with you that helps you lessen the grind by taking out enemies with you, who can also be substituted by any friend or sibling that wants to sit through this journey with you.If you’re a trophy hunter and have 3 hours to burn, snatch this grind fest up, If not – stay away.For what it isAction Adventure 5.5/10Overall: 5.5/10",0,No score yet,0,0,0,8.0,Generally favorable reviews,4,3,0

Gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real-world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney, UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona, Spain. Beyond the action-packed racing filled with fast curves, sneaky alternate routes, hair-raising jumps and fully realized damage models that provide for spectacular crashes, Blur’s narrative is presented through Bizarre’s new community-based interface, reaching far beyond the game itself. This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur’s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game. These new modes are immediately shared through Blur’s social network, expanding the game in ways that are only limited by the gaming community’s creativity.

You decide the role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge for humanity. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race. Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology.

Apocalypse is probably the best DLC that came out for Black Ops 2, With this map pack we got two new fresh faces and two not-so-fresh faces who got an uplift.

Be careful though, not all the buildings are accessable and it's quite easy to be killed and wonder ""Where did that come from?"" Dig: Courtyard with a facelift, any World of War veterans will have a grand old time on this map due to its familliar routes and flanks, however it does look proportionally better and will offer a neat setting to newcomers to the series. Frost: This map is the one that interested me the most, frozen Amsterdam was always the one that I was excited for, however, there are a complete lack of sightlines for Snipers and CQB gets real tense, especially across the frozenr river. Takeoff: It's Stadium from Black Ops.... I don't even think I need to comment... Finally, Origins: This is probably the best Zombies map Treyarch have ever released, the characters from previous games are back and it is a much welcome sight, they do tell a lot more of the story and are extremely vocal. The new weapons are gorgeous and the easter egg is phenominal, the giant Mechs and the Tank add interesting aspects to this map and I think any veteran of Zombies is going to appreciate this sendoff for Black Ops 2 Overall, 8/10  but it gets a ten from me due to some ridiculous reviews.",70,Mixed or average reviews,2,8,0,5.6,Mixed or average reviews,18,8,14

Both new releases almost come close to leveling both their predecessors on par...almost.After having bought Carnival Games I was rather anxious to try the gameplay out at home, fearing I might have just wasted my money on a dud. I am happy to report though that I'm rather impressed with this game as it will definitely go down with family ""functions"" and game nights for everyone. This title definitely delivers on the Kinect experience.Gameplay - Carnival Games feature mini games, in fact 20 of them, which you can play single or with another. This was done pretty well and the second person can join very easily and opt out just as easily. My wife and I got this going for a while and were pretty impressed by the co-op ability.Games are similarly structured to that of Kinect Adventures. Menus are easy to navigate and not that complicated as other Kinect titles have proven.I don't have much negative feedback for this game, as I truly didn't expect a masterpiece. This is entertainment for everyone after all. My wife and I agreed that Wii will have to shape up on this front if it want's to keep the family from leaving their ""experience"", as we also have a Wii at home and since Kinect has come out we have not used the Wii for family entertainment again...a little sad though as it gave us hours of fun with Wii Resort and other titles. As long as Kinect regulates the release of these games to ensure they aren't all released at the same time, the market should not be saturated by ttiles such as Kinect Adventures and now Carnival Games soon. The only problem being that of quality as other titles have proven to lack recently.Overall, a good buy.

What you may not know is that they are branching into software and publishing, so, low and behold Damage Inc – Pacific Squadron WWII. Damage Inc. is a fighter plane sim with the intention of bringing players a more realistic, dog fighting bunch of goodness. With 20 playable missions spanning various moments in war, starting in WWII Pearl Harbour, you are a rookie straight out of flight school progressing on your military voyage to become a decorated hero of the skies. Its plain a huge amount of time and effort has gone in to bringing real life resemblances to the dozens of planes and upgrades at your disposal. There are great explosions, loop the loops and (kind of) time warps galore. Unfortunately that’s where the good stuff stops. Visual elements in-game are far from that of being realistic, with graphics seeming grainy coupled with dis-proportioned landscapes & surroundings. I found myself enjoying the dogfights at first, but after a short while it felt I was loosing touch with the game and just slipped into auto pilot of shoot plane, bomb ship. Join that with trying to keep your sight on a tiny red dot (that “helps you”) to take down enemy planes, it was a chore at most. Also sprinkle in a big portion of crashes, the game not my piloting skills, bugs and glitches with mission fails and completions occurring, when your not even able to see what is happening but apparently still in control of the aircraft. With two controller set-ups at hand, arcade or simulation (which are unchangeable, unless you start over), trust me neither is stand out, so stick with arcade to save yourself any agony. Ok Ok, I could be shooting down the controls as there is a “special” joystick to tie in with the game, which I haven’t tested myself. But… I hear you say? Research has proven many found it easier with the joy-pad as the AV8R failed to navigate even the basics of the menu… I concur! Now I know this is an early venture for Team MadCatz and lessons will have definitely been learnt along way. Lets just hope & pray, if we do see that any more titles released under their name, they don’t crash and burn like this one. And finally without going into any more detail on how bad the game is, there really isn’t anything I can add. Maybe something other than if you love planes, want to look at them and see them in action.

Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself. Players take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses.

You can even quit this mode mid-game, and still keep all the red orbs and unlock slots you earned from this. It's basically just a way for DMC noobs to grind for money and upgrades so they can beat the game on ""Son of Sparda"" and ""Dante Must Die"" mode with all the Gold Orbs and Vital Stars they can use and with little effort. I was able to buy all the health and Devil Trigger Crosses by playing on Bloody Palace for a long time. This free DLC basically just kills the games replay value. And while all of that does disappoint me, it still has some fun within this Arcade mode. For example you enter a boss fight after every 20 waves of enemies you defeat, and the environment changes after a set amount of waves as well. This makes it so you won't get tired of easily beating the same enemies in the same drab areas so quickly. But this is not perfect, the time limit is basically pointless, I hardly ever found the clock going down expect during boss fights. And the boss fights are also what kills you in the end anyway because all the enemies in the main waves have shortened health, making progress too easy, especially when you've unlocked all of the weapons. I would've had more fun if this mode made it so you always begin the first wave with Dante only having ""The Rebellion"", and then you unlock the other weapons at certain points in the game. The boss fights are always in the same order of placement as well. (Beginning with the Succubus, then the Hunter, etc.) I would've been more pleased if the boss fights shuffle their order of appearances instead. (First boss fight being Bob Barbos on the first try, then first boss being Vergil on the second) Still, this is fun. But with it killing the point of the other modes, Bloody Palace is definably NOT a DLC you should even bother downloading if you value replaying the main game, especially on the higher difficulties.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,7.2,Mixed or average reviews,17,1,7

It manages to brilliantly capture the tense and edge of your seat moments of the sport, especially when playing with a friend. It has so many small touches that true cricket fans will love. The career is especially unique as your 16 year old created character slowly progresses in skill with successful gameplay. Conversely your characters skill level will decrease if you play poorly, creating a great sense of ""must concentrate at all times"" type of play which is true of the real sport. The most fun is found when playing against a friend and a few beers. I have spent many hours into the early morning the past few days and cannot recommend this game enough to ANYONE who even has a small interest in the sport. Its not perfect but its small flaws are easily forgiven and are promised to be patched shortly anyway. This IS the best Cricket game ever made, I promise you that. PROS:Ball physics are excellent.Manual appeal is genius.Actual split second reflex gameplay works.Fantastic community created players.Bowling is rewarding with field changes.FANTASTIC 2 Player fun.Career while difficult is very additive.Lots of game modes including excellent online.Replay system is awesome.Very In-depth create-a-player is super realistic. CONS:Commentary can be repetitive.Fielders throws hit the stumps far too often.Batting can be frustrating on Pro or harder.",0,No score yet,1,2,0,8.1,Generally favorable reviews,14,1,2

Having now played for around 10 hours I can say with a measured opinion that it has met and surpassed all my expectations.  I completed Origins and poured over 112 hours into the game.  I am by no means a simple fan boy and would have been bitterly disappointed had I not thought Bioware had put the same level of skill and commitment into the sequel.  I have not been disappointed and I fail to see where and why all the user criticism spawns from on this page.  I loved Origins and I feel no hesitation in stating that I believe DA2 is a much improved game.The pacing is much faster and more exciting, whilst keeping the focus of the narrative throughout - something Origins failed to do at times (there's a Blight going on?).The action and fighting dynamics have seriously been improved.  Remember people this is the Xbox 360 version we are reviewing and as a console version, it's fighting mechanics have been vastly improved.  It's fluid, it's faster and ultimately, it's more exciting.  There seems to be a theme arising that people believe it is more like a button basher now.  Can I remind you that the sole difference there is that now rather than simply pressing A once and having the character automatically attack, you now do so yourself.  I fail to see why this is a negative.The story is gripping and the character dynamics and interaction is as superb as it was in the original but with the vast improvement of a fully voiced character.  Furthermore, the characters are equally as funny, original and likeable as they were in the original - with the exception of maybe Morrigan (a favourite of mine).The graphics are, as expected, a considerable improvement and the scale of Kirkwall is impressive.  Another complaint stems from the fact that the majority of the game is played within it's boundaries but this is by no means a bad thing.  In fact, it makes perfect sense for the story which is being portrayed.Please, if you are considering buying this game, do not be put off by the overtly harsh criticism on this site and do so.  If you are a fan of rpgs and most particularly if you enjoyed the first game, I implore you to play this game: you will not regret it.",79,Generally favorable reviews,55,19,1,4.6,Generally unfavorable reviews,781,408,"1,234"

I am a massive RPG and Bioware fan from the Baldur's Gate era and have always felt confident that I will get my money's worth when purchasing one of their titles. Purely from an entertainment perspective, I always compare video game investments to movie theater pricing. Where I live, a movie ticket will run you $12 or more for 2-hours of entertainment (assuming you don't spend the additional obligatory $20 on soda, popcorn et al). So spending $60 on a Bioware game that provides 80+ hours of solid entertainment and story-telling that is often better written and voice-acted than most movies today...it is kind of a no-brainer. I personally feel that DA:O was the best RPG ever made (yes...Nostalgic Ones...better than BG2!). Was DA2 perfect? No. It did feel rushed and the repetitive environments did drive me crazy but...the characterization, story-telling and continued world-building was fantastic. I played it twice and (based on my movie theater comparison) felt I definitely got my money's worth. The amount of time, effort and finesse that goes into making these things is astounding to me. The almost rabid vitriol surrounding DA2 makes me concerned that Bioware will throw up their hands and abandon this great story. Removing myself from the maelstrom of herd-mentality negativity surrounding DA2 and comparing Legacy in an objective manner to other similarly-priced DLC, I thought it was great! I paid $10 for 3-hours of enjoyable entertainment. I recently spent $13 (before snacks) to see Captain America.

For 800 points i feel i have spent my money wisely and i think this DLC is proof that designers, when they communicate with their audience as Bioware have, are capable of crafting an experience that allows them to maintain a creative flair as well as cater to the wishes of the public. This DLC is fun, has interesting characters and presents a story that helps expand the Dragon Age universe and its people. A solid 7.

There wasn't a whole lot of hype about it, and at the same time there haven't been a whole lot of exciting releases for me lately.  I started watching this game close to release, and got excited at the fact that I might be able to go on a good dungeon crawl.Once i started getting into the game, I found the whole experience to be very positive.  Graphically the game was nice, and the structure to the game was that of a typical dungeon crawler.  The backstory was interesting, and I got involved with the character to the extent where I really cared about making a difference to the Legion and trying to restore us to glory.On top of that, the amount of loot was amazing- any true fan of an RPG with lots of loot will be at home with this one.  The character development was satisfying enough, with the ability of earn EXP and level up your character down the path that you see fit.  In terms of your abilities and their specialisations, you wont be able to unlock everything- so choices will have to be made.  To me, that is a big part of a good RPG- choices which mean you totally forgo other choices.The combat was great, it was smooth, intuitive and satisfying.  Once you get a hang for the 2 stances and your characters abilities, then you will be able to seriously kick some enemy ass.  The combat still had a good level of strategy to it, whilst feeling action packed at the same time.One semi-downside is the short time, even if you go through and complete all side quests and explore/re-explore sections of the world, it will probably take between 15-20 hours for most people.  For an RPG this  is relatively short, however it sort of felt right for this game- it definitely achieves what it needed to.  A saving grace to this fact is that there are 4 totally different characters, each of which play very differently, so you can play through with each of them once- this will add to re-playability greatly.I have played through twice so far- once on normal setting, and the next on the hardcore/nightmare setting.

I also have been an MMA Participant/Fan since the Beginning! I have Played everything from UFC on Dreamcast, Tapout 1 & 2 on XBOX, UFC Sudden Impact & PRIDE FC on PS2, Throwdown on Nintendo GameCube, UFC Undisputed 2009/2010 & NOW EA MMA on 360! That was Not meant to be a BragFest but rather a recap of Where My Opinions/Comparisons come from! The Original DreamCast UFC was, of course, the GroundBreaker that Started it all! UFC 2009, to me, was The BEST MMA game to Date! 2010 Seemed like a Rushed (to beat EA to release!) Cash grab and NOT Much More than a Roster Update with Few Real Notable changes. The Event Mode being the Most memorable & my personal Favorite.    Now for EA MMA!: First off if they would have named it something like ""EA Sports Presents MMA Featuring StrikeForce!"" there Might be LESS complaints about ""where are the UFC guys?""! Maybe! From the beginning I Too did Not give much chance for EA's MMA title. Like a Lot of Fellow gamers I  fell into the ""If it doesn't have the More Well Known UFC Fighters It will Probably Not be as Good!"" category! I am GLAD to say I was Wrong there! There are So Many Exclusive fighters that are as good or Better than their UFC counterparts In there own respective weight classes! There are also Very Extensive Fighter Creation/Share tools (They are Far Superior to THQ UFC's current version!) that Offer NEAR Perfect UFC Clones! For those Longing for Dream matches like Brock Lesnar vs Fedor Emelianenko Here is the Place to get it! Well this is as Close as we can get for now at least! There are also other Various COOL  Options to keep fights from getting stale. Venue Locations, Ring Types (Round, Boxing & Of Course Octagonal) Plus being able to set Rule types are a Nice and Refreshing change of pace! I haven't jumped into the Career mode so I can't comment on that Yet. I feel compelled to voice my concern and comment that ONLY EA can Tank (No. Not Paul Abbot!) its MMA Game at this point by Pulling the Online support like it has done with a Lot of its other Franchises! For MMA and just Fighting Game Fans alike EA Sports MMA is the BEST way to put a Digital BeatDown on/with your friends! I feel the Competition here Is a Good thing! Look at how Tekken, Soul Calibur & Street Fighter and Forza & Gran Turismo Push each other to improve! THQ and EA can continue to Pour quality features into their Games! In the end we win! Like Arcade Style Fighting, Racing Games etc... I have NO problem owning 2 MMA games. IF they are Both well made & are each worth having!    My reviews tend to be scatterbrained! For that I apologize. My Main goal is to Help Fellow gamers that are fans of the Same genre be able to enjoy quality games!

Their racers always provide accessibility over realism. They always have. I wouldn't expect that to change anytime soon. Put simply, they tend to make racing games, not driving games. If u want a hyper-real, exclusively open-wheel driving sim, you probably need to look into a desktop computer. That's just how it goes, i'm afraid. When it comes to videogames, open wheel racing just isn't as popular as Touring Car racing. Open wheel cars tend to be an addition, even an afterthought, rather than a focus on consoles. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's true. Even rally is  bigger draw on consoles than open-wheel. Personally, i'd love an Indycar & F[n] console sim, but they just don't exist. However, if you just want a hardcore driving sim (and if you can give up on the F1 fanboy stuff) Simbin's Racepro is available on the 360, it features a fair amount of open wheel racing, and it genuinely expects the player to have some real-world experience lapping real cars on real tracks. Best of all, it works pretty well with a controller, so you can have that ""Track-Day-On-The-Couch: experience without buying a $200 wheel/pedal/sequential shifter setup, or a $10,000 computer. For me personally, Forza Motorsport does the best job of capturing the feel of driving the actual cars offered in the game. I run an '00 S2000 and i test drive cars for fun, (cuz i'm a giant fkn lame-ass and am lucky enough to have very supportive, extremely understanding women in my life) so you can take my word for it, if you're so inclined. The whips all feel like they should in FM. The weight is in the right places, the engine and transmission quirks are what and where they should be, the suspension reacts just right, (ie: old 911s shuffle erratically, newer elises' understeer a bit if u don't know how to drive the, the original S2000s are as agile and as twitchy and as telepathic as they are IRL, the acceleration in an M5 feels...almost bizarre in contrast to the weight and size, &c), and even the grip gives out in the right places at the right speeds...provided your tires are comprable to the tires you have equipped in the game. You can actually buy a tuner mag and apply the setup, down to the numbers, to yer forza motorsport car and you'll achieve whatever it is yer trying to achieve with your tuning. And the AI is the best in the business. It adapts to you. If you have problems with the AI in FM, it's cuz you don't understand track racing. No offense intended. I'll explain what u mean. For example, if you play bumpercars to win, expect Forza's AI to PIT you right back. But if you respect racing rules and etiquette, giving way when yer line is lost, not brake checking at every corner &c, the AI will treat you with the same respect. In fact, choosing one driver to hassle is a fun way to create a heated rivalry over time. Simply, the Drivatar system is damn amazing. (Note that all this is NOT true for Forza Horizon, which is really good fun, but feels more like a Gran Tourismo or Grid Autosport or NFS Shift, in so much as the cars feel like they OUGHT to, based on the setup and balance and power, but NOT what they actually feel like IRL.) But Forza Motorsport is also a very forgiving driving game. Lift-off in a front drive automatic isn't an automatic trip to the wall, for example. Now, I don't have the credit score to test drive a Gumpert (if that's even possible...) but as far as a console game that requires you to really understand and be constantly aware of the physics and engineering behind driving a purpose built track car, RacePro is as good as it gets on any console, and you don't even need a wheel, which is amazing, frankly. Plus, as i mentioned previously, you get open wheel racing. Not the full on hump-the-leg F1 experience, but...honestly, all the fanboy stuff, (like complaining that the game is balanced just because mercedes had a great year) reminds me a lot of cosplay. Probably best to just go get an SCCA license or some tickets if it's really that important to you. No stay at home experience will ever satisfy that type of obsession. When it's that serious, it's the real deal or medication. (Really, not trying to be mean, just realistic. Give RacePro a shot. It has the F3000 license, among others, and that's as close as normal humans can get.) If there's a better true sim for consoles, please tell me. I'll buy it tonight. In the meantime, this is a cartoon of F1. It's good fun, and i even have the Vita version, but it's not really good enough to make me wanna buy it instead of one of the many other options. It's only because i already have all the other options that this game appeared on my radar at all. But i don't dress up as Zombie Senna for Halloween. (Best driver ever.

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

Fracture,Xbox 360,['LucasArts'],Day 1 Studios,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'Shooter', 'Third-Person', 'Sci-Fi', 'Sci-Fi', 'Arcade']",T,"Oct  7, 2008",['PlayStation 3'],Up to 12,"Amidst a backdrop of worldwide ecological and seismological chaos in the mid-2100s, the United States has been split in two by the ""Great Flood"". As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before.

As our economies and our way of life tumble into chaos, the superpowers clash to gain control. Set in a fictional future based upon the headlines of today, F.O.W. brings players into the world's next great war. As society succumbs to a worldwide energy crisis, a new global depression takes hold. Amidst this desperate backdrop, two superpower alliances emerge. Join the battle on the frontlines of tomorrow as the Western Coalition (U.S./E.U.) or the Red Star Alliance (Russia/China). Tomorrow's weapons, today: As depicted in F.O.W., the U.S./E.U. and Russia/China have combined their military research and budgets, and the result is over 60 next-gen vehicles and weapons inspired by military designs for the near future. This includes remote controlled drones, gun cams, and next-generation counter-measures systems, all of which are player-controllable. Use high-tech combat systems to collect and relay recon, targeting, and threat information between team mates. Target acquisition and sharing between vehicle occupants is just one example of F.O.W.'s focus on an advanced team play experience. The customization system allows players to grow their soldier to fit their play style by choosing a weapons loadout, as well as a technical specialization (role). As the game progresses each role will upgrade, providing advanced equipment and abilities. The system is a mix of RPG-like depth but with the accessibility of a fast-paced FPS. Frontline combat system: The main game mechanic featured in F.O.W. in both in single player and multiplayer, is the ability to join the forces on the front line. This front expands across large portions of a mission and will require a strategy to achieve the contextual objectives in order to move this front forward. Not only does this system keep the battle centric and players in the midst of the action, it gives a unique sense of advancement as your Division is rewarded with territory for their victories. Choose your path to victory: Within the front, players can take advantage of a sandbox of destructible elements and various weapons of war to create their own unique paths and strategies. Instead of failing and re-playing the same sequence of events, players can 'chip-away' with varied approaches, allowing diverse missions with high replay value.

The mechanics were identical to GTAIV. Good, because they are complex and I was already familiar with them, so the game didn't try to force me to learn new ones in the name of novelty. Like GTAIV, TBGT and TLATD were story driven action titles. Great. Unlike GTAIV, I got a chance to understand more fully the forces that were acting on Nico by following two parallel characters.

Just Dance 4 is in some aspects better than its predecessors, and while everyone is nuts for Dance Central, I'm staying with JD4, why? Because Dance Central is not as stylish, funny or even weird enough as JD4, making it one of the most awesome dance games ever made. The track list is phenomenal. We have everything! Literally!

Not like in Dance Central, where you have to practice every move 100000 times before dancing, as if you move the incorrect finger, the whole dance is wrong. Just Dance 4 is a little bit more for rookies in that aspect. It's really fun to generate a video after your dance and share it (If you dare) to your friends and family, and also the Just Sweat Mode, which isn't too extense unfortunately, is so fun for the first time it is enjoyable to put down some pounds. The only thing this game lacks of (And Dance Central nails it every year) is a campaign mode, something challenging, a story, doesn't matter how silly or non-sense it is, to make us return to the living room to dance even when we are alone. Just Dance 4 lacks of appeal to play it again. Except, of course, when you got homies at your living room and want to have fun. Also, not choosing the difficulty of the song is sort of a bummer, and if Ubisoft would just get to work on this small details, Just Dance would be the dance game of the year.

Most of you may have even forgot that its there!  After the pleasing list of games announced at this years E3, xbox have introduced a nice litte feature called Kinect Fun Labs available for download.  The basis is that the programmes you find in Fun Labs are more or less ""apps"" to use to show off what the Kinect sensor can actually do.  There are 4 apps available from launch: Kinect Me, Bobbleyhead, Googly eyes and Build-a-buddy.  Kinect Me literally does what it says on the tin, it makes an avatar version of you by taking a picture of your face and body.  Bobbleyhead.... well I think you can guess but its similar to Kinect Me except it makes a dashboard style bobblyhead of you.  Goggley eyes also doesnt need much explaining, you scan any object from you house into Kinect and it will animate it and place Goggley Eyes on it for you.  Last of all, Build-a-buddy allows you to scan any object into Kinect and then give it a personality. The concept of the above is great, there hasn't yet been a game that has included these features (for obvious reasons) yet seeing what Kinect can do gives real promise for features in later games.  I have to say the novelty of the above does wear off after about 5 minutes of each program but for something that is free, I am really not going to complain.  With more apps due soon I will be sure to keep trying them out and seeing what Kinect really can be capable of.

Players are immersed in the world of the Lanzheim Continent, a conflict-ridden land deeply divided by a fierce civil war. Powered by the Unreal Engine3 and featuring character designs by famed Korean artist Hyung-Tae Kim, the game bears a striking visual style unlike any other RPG through its blend of photo-realism and Japanese manga influences. The deeply emotional story is driven by beautifully rendered CGI cut-scenes featuring fully voiced dialogue to draw players into the immersive experience. Delivering more than 40 hours of gameplay, Magnacarta 2 features a unique battle system which combines strategic turn-based battles and real-time gameplay, creating a fresh twist on the traditional RPG formula. The game seamlessly blends world navigation and battles as everything happens in the same environment with no load screens or abrupt changes in the action when a fight begins or ends. Players can utilize objects found in the environment to their advantage and likewise, creatures and field objects dynamically react to the player’s actions. A free roaming camera further adds to the unrestricted interaction with the world. Players are also given flexible control over their party with the ability to pre-assign attributes for each AI character and freedom to easily switch control between all the characters at any time. Magnacarta 2 features a variety of adaptable options to keep the action fresh throughout the game. By defeating monsters, players obtain Kamonds which can be used to enhance a variety of weapons as well as create new items. When players change their weapon, they take on a different fighting style that adapts all the related moves and skills to that weapon’s attributes. While normal skills can be performed by any player at any time, special moves require skillfully timed actions to exploit the rhythm of the battle to their advantage. The pinnacle of special moves is the over-drive mode where players can use the most powerful combination of skills at one time to perform devastating attacks to defeat enemies. KAN (magic), representing the four elements of nature (Wind, Water, Lightning and Fire), adds another dimension to gameplay whereby players generate KAN for use in battle and to affect environmental objects in various ways.

The debut of Season 2, reuniting or meeting some of the characters I loved in Season 1. Just like in the first season, this kick starts with an interesting (though a bit dull story wise) way to show off some of the new mechanic this brand new season has to offer, and showing just what Jesse has been up to these past few years. I think what this starting episode did better than the starting episode of season 1 was make me very attached to this new antagonist. I have seen very little of this new antagonist, but what I've seen of him so far has given me some (hopefully) accurate first impressions; scary, hungry, and ruthless while at the same time seemed to really left something to be desired with Jesse, the main character. In terms of some of the other newer characters, they do seem interesting and were just enough to grab my attention, however a lot of them came in as soon as most of the older main characters were wiped off at the very beginning which makes me wonder that they only did that to inflict our interest to the new characters. For instance, this one particular new character who was introduced at the very beginning right before having the swansong of the original characters from season 1 for the remainder of the episode. It also seemed that this new character (with the name, Radar) has known Jesse for quite a while now, otherwise (depending on the players choice) you would barely trust them as much as Jesse did or as much as the older characters. Not to say that I hate these new characters, in fact most of them I really liked, I'm just saying that their introduction could've been a little better and less dull unlike the introduction to the original characters from the first episode of season 1. And as well as the main antagonist which I mentioned earlier, there is another antagonist we got to meet though a completely different category of character compared to the main antagonist. The main antagonist is very wicked, ruthless, snide and horrendous all at the same time while the other is sordid, roguish, nasty and a little austere. I had fairly mixed feelings on this semi-antagonist with me being convinced that she had a pretty indifferent personality, and being a cringe worthy characters in both a good and bad way. A good way because of how much I felt attached to this antagonist when first meeting them based off their nasty personality though in a bad way because of the very short time we had to know them and during the end of their time in the episode made my original opinions of her want to change due to them unexpectedly undoing one of their previous 'villainy' actions which was most of the reason why I came to really hate this person and begin to like her as a semi-antagonist. One of the other new characters we got introduced were a former explorer, adventurer and vigilante named Jack. As soon as he was introduced, he immediately became my favourite newly introduced character of season 2. There was very little I disliked about this guy; he was very intelligent, wise, and brave and cunning once you convince him on taking part of your next adventure, similar to when you convince Soren from Episode 3 to go with you who I also liked when I first met him, though in the next episode I got a new bad impression of him. I certainly do not want this to also happen to Jack in the next episode, but for now, I cannot wait to hopefully see him in action again as well as one of the old characters who was briefly shown at the very end.In terms of the story, at first during the prologue it was very dull and plotless, unlike the prologue in the beginning of season 1 which not only first introduced the first original characters with most of their personality, but showed that they had a purpose which would eventually lead up to them talking their greatest adventure very soon. This was NOT the sort of impression I got with this episodes prologue. When the main story does kick in however, it is something really interesting though not fun to watch like in season 1, but instead more intense to see a couple of your favourite characters themselves caught in a boot. Jesse is lured to a type of prismarine gauntlet glove of some description consisting of a very intensifying and ominous voice calling their name. This then leads to the very early stages of more possible danger to the world which they must fix with the help of the adventurer Jack. Once it is fixed, a whole new and bigger problem begins with the main antagonist being featured looking more evil and angrier than anyone ever has with Jesse. The episode ends right there with so many unanswered questions that I cannot wait to see continue in the next episode along with the return of some of the characters (possibly) such as an old season 1 character and hopefully the semi-antagonist. I cannot wait to see what more Telltale has to offer in this episodic series.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,4.2,Generally unfavorable reviews,6,1,9

Each player is defined by not only values to general abilities, but also a boat load of intangibles such as ""clutch hitter"", ""slow starter"", ""small ball"" (good bunter). The same goes for tracking stats, you can't find this depth of information even at a teams official website. In these areas the game is a 10.Graphics wise, the stadiums look accurate, especially noticed by playing a game in home town Busch. The players are cartoony with no legs, only feet. The bobbleheads look like the real counterparts and players are easily recognizable. I would give the game maybe a 5 or 6 on graphics, but to me it makes no difference. The graphics suit Baseball just fine and it makes it a fun atmosphere.For me It all comes down to gameplay. If you like a very slow pace, ""golf"" type meters, and complicated controls that allow you to hone your ""golf"" skills to make perfect pitches and throws all the time even with subpar players, then you will likely want to play 2k11 or The Show. If you like a fast pace and for the players attributes and ability to contribute more to good pitches or throws, then you will want to play Bobblehead Pros.One thing to note before a final decision, the fielding in Bobblehead Pros and be difficult to master. When ball is hit sharply, it takes poise not to panic and find the angle to scoop up the ball. If you like, you can turn auto fielding on as an alternative, but I prefer to tackle the difficult fielding and find it rewarding.In closing, I enjoy Bobblehead Pros the most of the three games due to the fast pacing between pitches and depth of player abilities.

I thought back to the ps2 era MK games and few positive adjectives came to my mind. Add to that the underwhelming MK vs. DC Universe of a few years ago and my hopes were decidedly bottom of the barrel when it came to MK9. But this morning I got a call from my brother this morning at 1:30 saying he had just picked up MK9 and was coming over. Now, you have to understand that I haven't heard from my brother in over a year. To make a long story short, at our parent's funeral in Winter 2010 there was a huge fight. My brother told me and the other siblings he would never speak to us again. It hurt to hear my big brother regard us so harshly and honestly, the last year has been hell for me. So when I heard from him this morning it was quite the shock.When he got here we exchanged few words and proceeded to start up the game on my 50"" HD TV. I was hesitant at first and refused to play versus mode to start, telling my brother to simply play story mode while I watched. It didn't take us long to realize how magnificent this game truly was. During one of the early cutscenes my brother let out in amazement ""it's like they're rewriting my childhood, hell yes."" I don't want to spoil anything for you, but the story mode is the most awesomely presented story in fighting game history. I'm not ashamed to say there were a few high fives exchanged amongst us when we finally beat the last bosses. I had to get my hands on all the characters after that. We immediately went into versus and started taking eachother on just like we had in MKII for the SNES. It was one of the best experiences of my life. The gameplay isn't hard to get into and I can tell there's going to be a lot of room to get better. Maybe one day I'll even be able to beat big bro!So as 7AM hit us and we decided to get some rest, I realized something. None of the old hardships came back to light. This was fun like My brother and I hadn't experienced in ages. Fun I thought I had lost forever. Through all the gore and friendly competition we both realized what makes us equals as men, but more importantly, what made us equal as brothers.

The one complaint that some might have is that the game requires you to complete a sequence of moves throughout levels without any warning- ie. you'll land on a platform only to be crushed by spikes a second later because you didn't know to immediately jump when you landed there.

You race through the 2010 Sprint Cup season against a field made up of most of the 2010 regular Cup teams and some high profile Nationwide and Truck Series drivers.  Aside from unlocking alternate paint schemes, there is no progression element in the game.  You begin with a top quality Sprint Cup team and do not  upgrade your car or progress to a better team.  A series of short 'Invitational' events also become available as you advance through the season which highlight some of the features of the game.  A practice mode lets you work on the setup of your car to find some speed when the default setup doesn't suit you. --- I experienced a lot of frustration trying to find a combination of difficulty settings that made the single player game consistently enjoyable for me.  There are a number of driver assist settings to experiment with although even with all of these turned off the car was rarely challenging to control.  AI skill level is more of a problem.  On most settings, I usually pull away to a 3 second lead within a few laps at which point a rubber band effect kicks in keeping the AI in formation behind me, too far back to apply any pressure but also out of reach of being lapped except during pit stops.  It is only at the highest AI skill level that opponents behave in a believable way.  The precision and consistency required at this level are more frustrating than fun for me, although I expect that some would enjoy it.  Configuring a race to include pit stops can make it more interesting, but also exposes more AI problems and deviations from the NASCAR rulebook. --- Of course, online multiplayer doesn't suffer from these AI issues and can be an incentive to hone your driving skills.  However, I experienced a lot of technical problems with online sessions if they had more than about half of the advertised 16 player limit. --- Posts on the developer's forum indicate they plan to release a patch to fix a number of the problems with the game.

NCIS,Xbox 360,['Ubisoft'],Ubisoft,"['Adventure', 'General', 'General']",T,"Nov  1, 2011","['3DS', 'PC', 'PlayStation 3']",No Online Multiplayer,"Your level of enjoyment in playing NCIS will largely depend on two factors - 1) what kind of NCIS fan you are, and 2) what kind of gamer you are. If you're not a fan of NCIS, you might as well stop reading now and find something else to play, unless you already love detective games or pixel-hunt games like Mystery Case Files and Cate West. Otherwise, NCIS is a game made for its fans, featuring all of the major characters from the series (although few of them are actually voiced by their respective actors), and the game's case scenarios were written by the same people who script the TV show. And in case you haven't noticed, Ubisoft published the game to appeal to the same players as its CSI games, but NCIS actually improves in this area, as development was shifted from the Chinese company that handled CSI to an internal Ubisoft studio that would better understand the property. All-in-all, NCIS pulls off everything that it tries to do in a reasonable fashion. Analog controls are quite manageable, considering you have to move a cursor around to point characters in the right direction. The cases are relatively compelling, and some of the storytelling is genuinely interesting. Graphics won't knock your socks off, but they're functional. The sound matches many of the show's mainstays, from the ""thump"" sound with its black-and-white snapshot at the beginning of each scene, to the opening theme and other tracks pulled straight from the series. Gameplay is varied, allowing you to pixel-hunt for evidence, photograph crime scenes, move bodies, help with autopsies and other forensic analyses, and even interrogate suspects. That being said, the simplicity of each task, combined with a completion meter, make it impossible to mess up, and once the 5 hours of crime-solving is done, there is little reason to play again. On the flipside of this, if you're looking for some quick achievements, NCIS is a pretty easy way to get them, and the game retails for $39.99 instead of the usual $60. So, if you're a fan of the show and enjoy video games on a casual level, NCIS is a decent purchase. However, the most discerning NCIS fans and hardcore gamers will find a lot to b**** about here. As I have already mentioned, the characters are not voiced by their actors, aside from David McCallum for Ducky and Robert Wagner for DiNozzo's dad, neither of which perform as well as they do on TV. Ducky even comes off as seriously creepy without the support of NCIS's on-set chemistry. The character models don't always look great, either. DiNozzo looks nothing like Michael Weatherly, McGee and Ziva look good from some angles and bad from others, and Abby probably would've been okay if her body movements weren't so unbelieveably stiff. Gibbs fares the best in his appearance, but his voice and lines are so non-Harmon that it's annoying. Everything about the game could've been more ambitious, especially considering that NCIS is the highest rated scripted show on television and has climbed in viewership every year for nine seasons. CBS could've taken a paltry $10 million out of the show's multi-billion-dollar revenue and really contracted something special from Ubisoft, but instead, they made something that's only slightly better than the other games of its type. In that way, NCIS is a missed opportunity, but it will still hold some interest for casual fans of the show or of detective gaming. Could be worse...â",35,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,2,9,4.0,Generally unfavorable reviews,1,2,4

The impressive thing is how responsive it is - I did the Fitness Challenge and so did my wife, but we both got different things to do, and the trainer said he'd seen enough of one drill for me, but not for her - so it really is watching and deciding what you need - and what it needs to work out how good you are, what your balance is like etc.    The assessment at the start is a bit of an intense introduction to the program, it came very close to utterly destroying me, but it gives me confidence that it really knows what's going on.  It really was hardcore, and for a non-exerciser like me, a bit off-putting - but it makes total sense.  If it doesn't push me to my limits then how will it know what I can do?  Off the back of that we got a personalised program - my wife and I chose the same goal, but we both got different drills - so this thing is really adaptive - and for something that almost killed me, surprisingly fun.    The menus are clean and simple, the feedback is generally good and the corrections when I get things a bit wrong are usually spot on - like telling me I'm leading with the wrong leg.  Of course this is Kinect, so not everything is 100% rock solid - but that's what you expect in a Kinect game.  As with most games you spend a lot of time with, the VO can get a little repetitive, but not so it's annoying. The first session is packed with tutorials for each drill, but if you've done it once you don't get it again, so the sessions start to flow better with time.  You do get new drills each session (well, I have so far) so every so often you'll get taught the new moves and it feels varied and it's a nice change of pace when the tuts kick in.    One last point - this is about as far from a game as you can get.  It's not fluff like Wii Fit, or Your Shape.  From what I've seen so far, it's a serious exercise program and I've got no doubt that if I can take it seriously and stick with it (fingers crossed, I'm such a slacker) then I'll see some decent results.",71,Mixed or average reviews,4,8,0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,14,1,4

When I go back to some of the Spectrum and Master System games I used to play, in a time when arcade 'pay more money or gameover' ruled the gaming world, I realise just how hard some of the games I used to play as a child were. Adventure platformers are a rare thing now. Heck, in the N64's generation they were pretty much the mainstream genre (Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie & Tooie, DK64, Mystical Ninja et al). The huge worlds are probably deemed too time consuming to develop nowadays.Pacman and the Ghostly Adventures stands as a polished, colourful example in a time starved of such games. It doesn't really offer anything new, but it does offer challenge and variety and plenty of fun. The graphics are sharp and colourful, the music ranges from chirpy, catchy tunes to epic orchestral pieces and there is plenty of content. The bonus levels offer the greater challenge and I found them to be the most fun.Also, I had no problems with the camera. If you choose to use the right stick to take control the auto camera may take a back seat for a brief while, but I tend to use manual controls to constantly tweak the camera in these sorts of games any way.

This is the ultimate bank robbery - achieved by stealthy guile or relentless force. Can you make history by planning the perfect heist? The Benevolent Bank, more commonly known as the Big Bank, has never been robbed. Many have tried. The Nestor gang in '40, the Beltway Bunch in '77. All failed. You're going to change that. Together with the Big Bank job, you also get the Falcon Rifle and its weapon mods as well as four all-new masks, materials and patterns. To give you a real challenge, 10 heist specific achievements have been added. Key Features: Introducing the Dentist  Brought to life by Giancarlo Esposito, little is known about the Dentist. He represents a large clientele whom he refers to as his patients. He is a determined, meticulate planner who has taken a great interest in the PAYDAY gang. He is the only one who knows how to free old Hoxton. The Big Bank is the first job the Dentist wants you to do. Perform well and there's no telling how deep the rabbit hole goes. The biggest heist in the history of PAYDAY  Few cities in America have the heritage of DC, and few institutions in DC boast the heritage of the Benevolent Bank. The Benevolent Bank is rich. You'll see it as soon as you walk in. Bohemian crystal chandeliers, counters of Tuscan marble and wealthy people as far as the eye can see. You could fit 10 Harvest & Trustee branches in the Benevolent Bank and you could fit a Robert's bank in the vault alone. Plan your heists like never before with Preplanning  Preplanning is a new feature that allows you to learn more about the target, and plan out your perfect heist. If you are planning to do a stealth job, focus on surveillance, easier access, and bypassing security. If you plan on going loud, plant supplies at strategic points, and choose fast approaches and exits. Preplanning is paid for with cash and favors; however, you can only call so many favors before you raise suspicions and the feds start looking for you. Choose wisely: some plans call for a lot of favors, while others only take a single phone call. ""The right arm for the Free World""  Hard hitting and lethal. The Falcon Rifle offers a blend of the 7.62x52mm's stopping power in a highly modular package. With over 50 years of service worldwide it's seen its fair share of battles and proved its reliability in such environments. Keep in mind it's length and hefty recoil when engaging in a brawl with the law. If used correctly it'll prove to be a valuable asset and a worthy addition to the PAYDAY gangs arsenal of weapons. Modify it to fit your play style using the accompanying 9 weapon modifications. 4 new masks based on our forefathers  Four new masks are added to the game, themed around founding fathers and presidents of old. Ever wanted to rob a bank wearing a mask of good ol' Washington? Now's your chance. 4 new materials and patterns  Four additional materials and patterns have been added to go along with the four new masks. How about a mask made of exclusive marble? Sounds pretty sweet in our opinion. 10 new achievements with in-game rewards  For any serious bank robber out there, 10 new heist specific achievements can be unlocked. Each achievement unlocked gives a specific in-game weapon modification to use with the Falcon Rifle.",0,No score yet,0,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,0,0

The new hero is awesome, combat varied, the exploration worthwhile (you never know when you will find a new great weapon or a legendary item), piracy is still there, as in Risen 2, but it's not a main theme anymore - merely a storytelling tool - and works great.

Garcia is powerless to stop Fleming, but instead follows him back to the underworld along with his demon sidekick, Johnson, who also acts as his gun, torch and motorcycle. In the demon world, Johnson helps guide Garcia through the twisted nature of the demon realm, defeating numerous enemies that try to feed on Garcia's flesh, and keeping him away from the darkness that destroys the human flesh. As they travel, they witness numerous deaths of Paula by Fleming and other demons, all to toy with Garcia's senses. Another human demon hunter, who simply goes by the name ""Colonel"", temporarily aids Garcia, but then leaves to get revenge on the death of his loved one, only to be brutally killed later. Garcia also encounters an ally in Christopher, a half-human, half-demon that sells Garcia valuable goods to boost his demon-fighting powers. Later in the game, Garcia and Johnson learn of the Unbreakable Huntress, the first female demon slayer to ever challenge Fleming. The Unbreakable Huntress challenged Fleming, but was brutally dismembered by the demon king. Impressed with her refusal to surrender even when reduced to a quad amputee, Fleming made the Huntress into his queen, only to repeatedly kill her over and over again, healing any wounds that resulted from the torture. In rebellion, the Unbreakable Huntress continued to escape from the City of the Damned, only to be dragged back and killed by Fleming. Paula is hinted to have been the Unbreakable Huntress prior to the start of the game. Eventually, Garcia reaches Fleming's ""Castle of Hassle"", and battles his way through to its top, where Fleming awaits him, Paula encased within his cloak. Fleming enters into battle with Garcia, but Garcia gains the upper hand, and destroys him. He rushes to Paula's side, but she hits him, angered that he watched her die over and over and made no attempt to stop it or comfort her. Furious, she transforms into a demon herself, and attacks Garcia, but Garcia eventually weakens her enough. Paula reverts to her human form, and as she lies wounded and the darkness surrounds them, Garcia comforts her and apologizes. In the epilogue, Garcia and Paula have returned to his home and are planning for a trip, when Garcia receives a call from Fleming, warning him that more demons are coming for him. Garcia takes this in stride, commenting that as long as he is dating the Lord of Demon's mistress, demons will continue to follow them, and he vows to kill every last one.",76,Generally favorable reviews,49,27,0,8.2,Generally favorable reviews,124,42,6

Using the ancient technique known as Mind Magic Kaos is now able to create DOOMLANDERS! Now it’s up to you to create Skylanders of your own to defeat Kaos and save skylands! Skylanders Imaginators brings a more classic style of gameplay to the Toys to Life Genre and with its new creating your own skylanders feature, it’s something to get excited about. However, that would be selling it short.Skylanders Imaginators includes a huge variety of levels & bosses and an introduction to the new card game, Creation Clash!  I found myself playing again, again and again. But I think I should get on to the game itself.The game itself includes some complex levels and includes some more simplistic puzzles even considering the target audience.  Now this isn’t to say the game isn’t fun or the levels aren’t unique. It’s just as I had been playing it for a few hours and the game itself just gave you the same challenges, over and over again.  Generally, it includes complex lock puzzles, grinding down vines, pushing obstacles around and escaping a maze. All of these are great yet there wasn’t the huge spark & variety that Superchargers and Trap Team did provide. I found the game alot quicker and smoother compared to the other games in series. It flowed correctly and didn't feel super slow like SuperChargers or Trap Team which neither I was able to complete because I got bored. The combat itself felt just right and it did feel like I was actually doing something instead of just hitting a bunch of buttons. This is not to say I wouldn’t more combat variety though. Most of the characters you’ve had for 5 years still won’t have new upgrades. The Skylanders created have similar controls and powers to the corresponding element of the creation crystal. This is not to say this isn’t a good game, it’s just to say I would’ve liked a bit more variety with powers.And of course, there are elemental worlds, Sensei Shines and battle gongs. I found myself having to play through the whole 1 hour level to get to a Sensei Shine, and I found it a bit annoying having to do this as for I think they should’ve provided more options to get SkyChi because not everyone has every Sensei at the start of the game and it’s a bit unfair to those who enjoy the game and considered buying another one of those Skylander Toys. With the introduction of Crash Bandicoot and Dr Neo Cortex, it definitely made the game shine as well!The story itself was, good but was extremely simple even considering the target audience. Although it was fun to see each of the characters making humorous clean jokes all the time! The gameplay was GOODThe story was OKThe Objectives were OKThe Uniqueness & Creativity was GOODAnd the Graphics were GREAT To conclude this was another strong & entertaining game from Skylanders.

Sleeping Dogs: Nightmare in North Point,Xbox 360,['Square Enix'],United Front Games,"['Action Adventure', 'Modern', 'Modern', 'Open-World']",M,"Oct 30, 2012","['PC', 'PlayStation 3']",,"How did Sleeping Dogs turn out the way it did? A cancelled True Crime game with gameplay elements borrowed from everything should be terrible, not one of the best open-world games ever made. The polish on display was kind of blinding. So when I saw the Nightmare in North Point DLC on sale over the holiday, I had to jump on it. Not to get ahead of myself, but the quality of this DLC convinced me to purchase another $5′s worth as an excuse to keep playing. Quit making entertaining stuff, United Front! If the content on offer is any indication, the idea behind the Sleeping Dogs campaign DLC seems to be fun tongue-in-cheek homages; specifically to 70s~80s Asian film genres that bled into the public consciousness of the West. Based on the various names I got while saving, Nightmare in North Point seems to be paying tribute to Big Trouble in Little China. Maybe there’s a movie about the Jiang Shi that I never saw, but the general tone of North Point matches up well with John Carpenter’s delightfully silly masterpiece. An undead Sun On Yee member, freshly escaped from Hell along with a ton of demons, has kidnapped one of Wei Shen’s one-off girlfriends. Shen does not approve, so you must send the hordes back where they came from if you ever want to get…whatever it was you wanted from Not-Ping. (It’s been a while) To do this, you must traipse across Hong Kong and gather some odd ingredients for a demon-killing tea. It’s a silly concept, but if you can’t find any humor in throwing Chinese demon/vampires into vents head first, then Sleeping Dogs was never the game for you. Since Nightmare in North Point is an entirely different executable on the menu, the combat moves you may have unlocked during the campaign have disappeared. A few carry over  you can break arms if you so desire  but the basic set does its job well enough. Over the course of the DLC, you get some items back, along with a safehouse. But your arsenal never quite reaches the heights from the main game, so you may need to re-evaluate your tactics if you’ve grown too reliant on that amazing counter  grapple move. As you’d expect from the name, you’re limited to exploring North Point. The rest of Hong Kong is blocked off, but you can run around the area killing Jiang Shi all you want once you’ve finished the campaign. Thankfully, all the Halloween in the world can’t dilute Sleeping Dogs’ potential for insanity. You can still grab a motorcycle and ramp it off a sports car while unrelated vehicles blow up for no reason, but now there are vampires. Maybe the developers should have given players more tools, because this DLC is actually kind of difficult. A basic group of Jiang Shi isn’t too hard to dispatch, but when you start talking about six knife-wielding gang members and ten Jiang Shi, then we’ve got a problem. These combat scenarios feel like they were plucked from the end of the core game, but in the campaign your arsenal is far more expansive. The repetitive ‘pick up monsters and bring them over to a prompt to stop them from spawning’ missions have a tendency to slow down the game a little, but it’s not that different from dragging gangsters to have their skulls bashed in with environmental kills. As long as I’m going over flaws, it’s worth noting that I’ve heard reports of buggy scripting  at least in the PC version. Everything worked fine on the Xbox 360 copy I played, but if you like playing games on your computer, keep that in mind. I must be frank here: Nightmare in North Point is more Sleeping Dogs. There are kind of broken chases, magnificent combat, and everything else I detailed in my original review. As an excuse to mess around in this world again, you could do far worse than a genuinely fun piece of DLC. But for those of you who are looking for something more than standard open-world missions with a coat of paint worth a few chuckles, maybe you should look elsewhere. http://www.velocitygamer.com/sleeping-dogs-nightmare-in-north-point-dlc-review/",0,No score yet,0,1,1,6.2,Mixed or average reviews,3,3,3

Which yes, the difficulties actually vary the gameplay. Hardcore is incredibly hard, the flashlight runs out in probably ten to fifteen minutes. It depletes on the other difficulties except for easy. The experience was overall fun, from the beginning through, it is based around exploration surprisingly. I really enjoyed walking around the full and complete maps to find every collectable. Some collectables are vital to know the story, some are just signs and cool little additions. I spent fifteen hours playing this game on every difficulty setting, collecting every collectable, and getting every achievement. I still enjoy replaying it. The game also features a little randomization, while small, the notes in The Eight Pages section are randomized locations. Spawn points are one of two places I have discovered. Some landmarks even change locations. The flashlight in the beginning is in different locations, generators, the path to follow near the end. I found the game to be jump worthy. It scared the living daylights out of me, every villain. Play this with the Oculus and you may have a heart attack. I'm not kidding. There are nine main levels, some are based solely around exploration. 5 of the 9 have real threats to the player. The music score is compelling and it really adds to the game's overall atmosphere. This game really surprised me with its release, sure there's bugs and a couple glitches near the beginning of the game. Once you get past those though, it's really an amazing game. The easter eggs are featured in the game as well that were in the PC original release. It features a recreation of the original The Eight Pages map. And it's overall a solid game. The game should take you on your first playthrough, approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. You will love to replay it though, and be prepared to jump. The characters have a backstory, the events roll out in sort of a twist. Everything makes sense if you really are focused on the game. There are secrets, hidden scares, it really is an indie masterpiece. I would love for Blue Isle Studios to follow this and make another Slender game just like it. It blew my mind, full 10/10. Brilliant, no developer can do this better. There are discounts on the game every now and then on the 360, I know Steam has outrageously cheap prices for it every now and then. So there is no excuse for a big survival horror fan to not pick this up.",61,Mixed or average reviews,0,4,1,6.6,Mixed or average reviews,22,4,12

Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions,Xbox 360,['Activision'],Beenox,"['Action', 'Action Adventure', 'Adventure', 'General', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", 'Linear', 'Fantasy', 'Third-Person', 'Fantasy', '3D']",T,"Sep  7, 2010","['PC', 'PlayStation 3']",No Online Multiplayer,"It's been a long time since I've played any Spidey games personally, ever since the sand box style gameplay came around I pretty much gave up on the series, even though I used to purchase just about all the ones that came out. I gave up on it all though after Ultimate Spider-Man.There was a gleaming light of hope however when this gem was announced. Gone is the repetitive free roam style, and Spidey returns to real, level by level gaming (or in this case, split up in Acts). You play as four different Spider-Men after the Amazing Spider-Man shatters the Tablet of Order & Chaos, a mystical relic that apparently grants great powers to evil minded villains (even when only in pieces), in a scuffle with Mysterio. This begins Spidey's journey to recover the tablet shards and restore order before these villains dish out complete havoc. The storyline is basic, and doesn't change from start to finish, which I personally don't mind, I'd prefer an overly-simple story over an overly-complex one (which most comic books and games in general do now-a-days), so I suppose it's a breath of fresh air to not get any dumb plot twists and other stupid things of that nature.The graphics are pleasing to the eyes, looking they were torn straight out of the comic book pages and onto our televisions. Every dimension (Amazing, 2099, Noir, Ultimate) has a unique look and feel to it. Amazing looks just like the comic books, 2099 is very bright with lots of lights and flashing, Noir is very dark and mysterious (the sky looks awesome, just thought I'd mention that), and Ultimate looks pretty much just like the Ultimate comic (probably the more lackluster of the three since the Amazing universe does that too). Gameplay is where this game shines. Each universe has a different gameplay style, from the Noir stealth, to the crazy free-falling 2099. Amazing and Ultimate are a bit more on the normal side though, but that doesn't make them any less enjoyable to play through. Each stage has a lot of variety, and plenty of nooks and cranny's to explore for Spider-Emblems, and Hidden Spiders (which give you more Spider Essence to purchase upgrades). There's plenty to do in this game, due to the Web of Destiny, which is a series of challenges or goals that you must do to unlock the entire web. As you unlock more challenges, you gain access to more of Spidey's special moves and new costumes, so you don't want to ignore these. Some of them are inevitably unlocked (such as defeating a boss, etc), but a lot of them are not, and you won't want to ignore them. I also must mention that zipping around the stages couldn't be easier with the easy to learn control scheme, and beating the crap out of enemies is a real pleasure too. There's also the first person view brawl scenes with the bosses, which I thought were weird thing to add at first, but it grew on me very fast. The camera has its problems I suppose, though to be honest I've only had issues with it when I'm wall crawling, which I rarely do anyway.The sound is great, notably due to the amazing voice actors of the Spider-Men and their foes. A lot of classic Spidey VA's are here, with funny lines and witty phrases being spout at every corner. It was a trip down memory lane for me, hearing Noir Spidey in particular, since I loved the 90's animated series, though I'm sure others will be partial to other VA's. The music isn't memorable, but that doesn't mean it's bad either. It gets the job done, to say the least. I particularly enjoy the music of 2099 and the Noir universes. I'm guessing by this point it's obvious that my two favorite dimensions are those two, since I continually mention them with praise.This game is a must buy for Spidey fans, and fans of the action genre, or just plain anyone that's into a good game. There's a lot of potatoes with the meat with the Web of Destiny, 3 difficulty levels, rankings, and alternate costumes, so there's a lot of reason to go back and continue playing (probably more than the reasons I mentioned here). This is a great direction for Spidey, and I hope Activision keeps Beenox on board for their next Spider-Man release.

Stacking: The Lost Hobo King,Xbox 360,['THQ'],Double Fine Productions,"['Miscellaneous', 'Puzzle', 'Action', 'Puzzle', 'Action']",E10+,"Apr  6, 2011",['PlayStation 3'],,"So if you haven't played Stacking, you should. It's definitely a solid game with a bunch of laughs. And if you think Stacking is always cheesy, that is where you are wrong. Of course, I am here to review the DLC, not the actual game. However, had I reviewed the game itself, I would have given the game a 9 for how well made it was made, although I would have panned that the hints made the game feel too easy to get all of the challenges.The Lost Hobo King is rather cheap, I must say. I honestly expected the DLC to be something that of 560 MSP or 800 MSP, but THQ and Double Fine were kind to have the price as just 400MSP! The story of the DLC is rather simple. Charlie travels to the kingdom of ""Camelfoot"" with Levi (who you may remember from the main game as the guy who created monuments of Charlie's adventures). Charlie is to help uncover the lost crown, so that Levi's uncle can become king of the Hobo's. You are to try and find three blacksmiths, whom of which are the only three people who can create the lost crown. The DLC will possibly take you around half an hour to complete if you were just trying to speed run through it, although if you were like me (I was trying to get 100% achievements on Stacking as the DLC was the remaining achievements I needed), you may want to try and collect everything, in which case, it could take you more than an hour and a half.If you don't know the way of Stacking, it is rather simple. You are a very small Matryoshka doll, and every character in the game is also a Matryoshka doll. You need to stack inside other dolls in order to solve puzzles to progress to the next stage. Stacking inside other dolls allows you to do comical stuff, such as in the new DLC, you can stack inside a bunny. If you hop near people, they will also hop for fun. Another is a person wearing a submarine helmet with fish hooks all around it. You can use the ability, in which the submarine will destroy any dolls that get in the way of the hooks. Rather cool, huh? The DLC adds 15 unique dolls, and a bunch of regulars which you will see all over the map. Most of the dolls abilities are unique to those from the main game, so Double Fine have certainly outdone themselves.The DLC also adds 10 new Hi-Jinks. A couple of them you can work on your own, but a couple may take you a while to figure out, or may force for you to look up how to solve them. Hi-Jinks are challenges you need to complete. Since there are ten, I suppose I could spoil one: ""Smoked Meat"" - Use the ""Smoke Out"" ability on any doll with a meat hat.You need to do that one five times in order to complete the Hi-Jink. Believe it or not, that was the final Hi-Jink I needed before I got 100% achievements. Speaking of which, the game comes with four achievements. They are the same as those from the main game, which are to just complete the DLC's story, unlock all the Hi-Jinks, collect all unique dolls and find all the ways to complete the challenges.Again, like the main game, the hints allowed you to work out all the challenges by yourself, which it's always tweaks like these why games are getting too easy. Although, this game does seem to appeal to children (sort of), so I suppose Double Fine had to consider that. Also, you know how a lot of games seem to have zombies? Umm... well there's something I should tell you. Come closer child... closer... *whispers* There are also Zombies in the DLC! *returns to normal voice* (UPDATE: They're actually called Ghouls. I felt I had to Tim, even though you said it didn't matter. They're zombies to me!)Stacking is no doubt a lot of fun, and even though it's set out like a silent film, it never gets in the way on how enjoyable it is. For 400MSP, I think this is a perfect slice. If this was priced at 560MSP, I may have had a few things to say. At 800MSP, I would be fuming. If you loved the main game, you will think of the Lost Hobo as another appealing mission as if it was already in the game itself. I can't help but wonder though... is there a gallery which tracks your collectables like in the main game with Levi?http://www.nave360.com/review-the-lost-hobo-king-stacking-dlc/ for actual review.",71,Mixed or average reviews,3,4,0,8.7,Generally favorable reviews,6,0,0

However, I'll be honest: I'm not the biggest Ferrari fan. (I root AGAINST them in Formula 1, and I prefer Lamborghinis, Lotuses, and American muscle.) Therefore, I thought for a while before purchasing this game, as it's exclusively focused on putting historic and modern Ferraris through their paces on racing tracks. Plus, I prefer open-world racing games, or at least those that FEEL like open-world (Need for Speed: The Run). Now that I've been playing this game for five days, I am very glad I did decide to get it. The cars are rendered beautifully, which, if you love Ferraris, will mean even more to you than it does to me. And I LOVE the way they handle. When you're driving an old GT car or historic single-seater, they feel exactly as I'd expect them to feel. You're going to have to deal with some bumps throwing the car off balance, and other realistic quirks. As you proceed to modern cars, such as the turbocharged F1-87 Formula 1 car, you'll feel a complete difference. You can absolutely experience the evolution of transmissions, brakes, and suspensions in this game! I'd say that's a big accomplishment. You know how some people call certain sports cars ""driver's cars?"" That's what this game feels like: a driver's game that's a lot of fun if you want not TOO much of a challenge, but not an arcade racer that would bore the simulator folks. As to the missions in the campaign mode, this is an extremely structured, linear game. That being said, I really have enjoyed the missions. You'll do things that just ""feel"" like accurate real-life challenges, such as playing ""follow the leader"" with the Ferrari team's number 1 Grand Prix driver while you're learning. Or making sure to win a race while also making sure that your teammate finishes 2nd, for a nice 1-2 photo finish. If you love Ferraris, I'm almost positive you'll enjoy this game. If you love any racing game that's a challenge, AND isn't completely unrealistic in terms of handling, then you'll appreciate this game even if you aren't a Ferrari nut. Recommended.",61,Mixed or average reviews,1,19,1,5.3,Mixed or average reviews,9,6,12

These 5 new stories are short, brutal, unique situations with 27 characters in total. 400 Days is supposed to be a new experience, but with the awesome Walking Dead atmosphere. These new experiences bring in very interesting situations with a lot of variations, and i love them all, even though i love Clementine, we always need something new. Now, as this is 5 new characters that we only have around 15-30 min with, we only get to know them in a very short amount of time, sometimes they tell about themselves to a person they just met, or you just have to listen to people talking with that person about maybe their sister or what crime they committed etc. For the most part, this works, but sometimes you can get a little lost. You also don't get the same attachments with these characters considering it's only 15-30 min with them, unlike Lee and Clementine, in which we had 10 hours to connect with them. But these 5 stories are intense, scary, brutal, and still emotional even though the short time. They all even have their own tone, which is really nice! The thing that i also like, is all the connections, because of these connections, i'd recommend you play through the stories by the time, Vince (2nd day) first, and last, Shel (236). You might remember a choice you made in Season 1 or in the previous story, and you might see a character from Season 1 or another story, and my reaction was either sad, happy, or just simply ""OH MY GOD!!!"". 400 Days is also full of plenty suprises along the way. The only negative about it is its short length. Sadly i can't give it a 9.5 here at Metacritic so i'll just give it a 10 :). www.youtube.com/headshotprolol -William",80,Generally favorable reviews,19,5,0,7.7,Generally favorable reviews,83,35,10

Incredible atmosphere & amazing graphics combine with Patrick Stewart's voiceover to give a very strong atmosphere which is very cinematic & involving. You really want to find out what's coming next. Unfortunately the game has massive problems which is such a shame as it really does look fantastic & plays like an interactive 2D platform game movie in the best possible way. The problems I am talking about are as follows: 1: Unforgiving ridiculously difficult gameplay.2: Constantly dying & only progressing through trial & error as the objectives are not clear at all.3: Poor checkpoint placement so you have to backtrack a lot on certain sections.4: Very hard to attain achievements for completing the game without dying make this virtually impossible to ever get all 200GS on. Most players will struggle to get even 50GS for beating it once as the achievements are very poorly written & do not give enough reward to players for beating the game. It should have given all the achievements for beating the game once! let alone without dying!!!5: Hazard animation timing is too severe/critical so this contributes to you dying a lot.6: Pixel perfect unresponsive controls. Such a shame as I can see no way this can be fixed or tweaked with any patching. Casual players will avoid as its too time consuming to replay the same section over & over for hours just because the game does not make it clear how you can progress. If it did not have these problems & was an easy to play/progress game with more checkpoints/gameplay options (there are no difficulty selections) then I would give it 10/10 its really a stunning looking atmopheric game which is faithful to the original HG Wells source material & without a doubt an alltime great 2D platformer if only it had enough QA testing these problems would have been ironed out before release. As it stands its a tragic release as the game promises so much but the unforgiving gameplay, poorly conceived checkpoints/achievements & unresponsive pixel perfect controls cause nothing but frustration to the player & add nothing to the experience only remove you from the game as you start to question why on earth they did not make the game much easier & more about experiencing the story/presentation instead of fighting against the poorly tested finished product.",55,Mixed or average reviews,6,12,12,5.1,Mixed or average reviews,1,3,3

I will always and forever be mad at EA for removing the ability to build your swing.  That to me was the best feature they ever had in the game franchise.  Needless to say, you can still do the game face, bringing some reality into the game.  Although the skin mapping and textures still need a little work, it looks about 90% of what you look like.  Being an avid golfer, putting Augusta into the game means the world.  There is just something about the course that other course in the game just don't have.  The course itself in the game is AMAZING looking.  You can really tell that doing the laser scans of each hole has made a huge difference in graphics.  I'm really looking forward to them doing this for all the courses in the game. As for play in the game, it's definitely better.  The caddie is nice to have, but he can get pretty annoying as I prefer to hit the shots I want to hit anyways.  Sometimes he will give you a good idea of how you could play the hole or a certain shot, some non golfers don't always understand how being creative on the golf course can pay off (hook, slice, punch ....).  I really like that you have a wider variance in your shot.  What I mean is in the previous versions, you aimed to a spot and your shot hit the spot as long as you didn't sway too far from the center on the swing or percentage of the shot.  In the new game, you might think you hit it dead straight, but no golfer is perfect and unless you use some focus, there is a wider area where the ball can and does go.  It brings you back to the reality of playing golf in the real world, not just some computer based game that hits perfect every time, what fun is that? The lie on the grass now affects your ball more and you can also now check to see what it is.  How amazing is it that on a side hill lie with the ball above my feet that it will actually hook, but more amazing is that I can check that number and adjust correctly for it, about time EA. You now have the ability to choke down on your clubs, how freaking awesome is that?  I can't tell you how many times I do this when I normally play to take distance off a shot and now I can do the same in the game, very nice addition. I'm also glad they got rid of the giant BOOM every time you hit the ball, wow, that got pretty annoying. Although the transition sound between shots has a ton of bass and my sub really goes nuts on it.  The music in the game is great though, it's simple and fits with golf very well.  Previous years had really hip hoppy music, which is fine, but doesn't really fit with playing The Masters.  Don't plan on playing in The Masters during your first season in the regular tour, because you probably won't have the tour ranking to get in.  This is great and gives the game some much needed replay value.  The Masters moments are amazing too, being able to hit shots that were key to years past, wow, can't say how much fun that is.  All in all, it's a giant leap forward from 2011 and my only gripes are that you can't turn the caddies off for good, or that you have to buy certain courses to play all the tournaments during the year.  Otherwise, worth every penny.",80,Generally favorable reviews,42,8,0,6.1,Mixed or average reviews,15,3,9

While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 of the world's most famous aircrafts, as well as being able to dogfight over realistic modern landscapes that have endured years of post-war trauma.

The game time has clicked it way up to 2015, but everybody is still driving around in '56 Fords. (Not implausible, given how they're built, but it gets stale.) And that was the problem: the game just got stale. Thus, the entire objective of Modern Times was to address this and fix it. So how does it do? In short: well. Modern Times is a genuine expansion pack, adding something to every aspect of the game: there are new edicts to issue, new scenarios, and new buildings...LOTS of new buildings. This is the best part of the pack: rather than your island being a static creation, it now evolves with the times. New buildings become available as technology progresses, and old buildings can be renovated and updated. You're given the opportunity to improve the lives of your people with new building upgrades...who wouldn't be happier in the tropics with some nice new A/C? But it's the progression of buildings that's really the prize; it effectively makes Tropico 4 a new game. Would-be dictators won't get much out of this pack, but the civil leaders will appreciate the ability to build new, more efficient, and almost universally extremely well-rendered buildings. (Most of them really are works of art, too.) The only point knock-off for this review is that the console version really suffers for being on the console: an Xbox clearly does not have the processing and memory chops to do the job right, so the gameplay begins to suffer as the island expands. Worse, game saving becomes unreliable once the game progresses for decades. Even so, Modern Times is well worth any Tropico-lover's time and money.

Don't believe the bad critics about this game, especially fom the gun-crazy-pro-violent-fast-paste-brainless-action media-type, which unfortunately comes mostly from the U.S.  It's quite as fun as fable with less than beautiful graphics (think xbox graphics) and a little less user-friendly (i.e. quest solving can take more time than usual because of bad map and quest indicators),  It has a good story, interesting quests, decent combat and magic mechanics.  The camera is a bit shaky during intense battles. It's much longer than the way too short Fable games. Some media writers complain about the map because it's inadequate. Inadequate, it is, but I'm sure this complaint  comes from the same gun-crazy-give-me everything easy-violent-and -fast media writers that are not used to and do not want to explore and find things on their own.  To find things on your own can be quite enjoyable for an RPG player but it can be very frustrated to someone who just plays game to kill and run to get to the next level.  There's another thing I noticed, by reading critics from this game and from many other games in wich there is a female lead character, is that de facto those games rub the media critics the wrong way just because they use a female character, and, god forbid, she be sexy. I don't know why this is?  I believe part of it comes from an anti-Lara-Croft overexposure of girl-powers and part of it comes from male writers saying: a beautiful girl like that can't be that strong and female writers saying: a strong girl like that can't be that beautiful.  It's too bad because, in my opinion,  games where it's possible to play as a female character tend to be less about brainless action and more about exploration and solving.",42,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,7,7,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,15,6,4

Xbox Live Arcade Compilation Disc,Xbox 360,['Microsoft Game Studios'],Various,"['Miscellaneous', 'Compilation', 'Compilation']",E10+,"Oct 23, 2007",,Up to 4,"The Xbox Live Arcade Compilation Disc is a definite must-buy as it has 5 excellent Xbox Live Arcade games, which are: PAC-MAN Championship Edition, a great remake to PAC-MAN, with Championship Mode ( the original mode) Challenge Modes 1 and 2, and Extra Modes 1,2 and 3. Extra Mode 1 is Regular PAC-MAN, but with everything (including PAC-MAN's movement) sped up. Extra Modes 2 and 3 have little to no difference to Championship Mode. PAC-MAN Championship Edition is a great remake to an all-time classic arcade game. Score: 8/10. Next up on the Live Arcade Compilation Disc is Boom Boom Rocket, which is (in my opinion) the best game on the disc. The gameplay is like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero, even the logo font is stylised like Dance Dance Revolution. But in this game, you have to press the matching button to the firework just as it goes past the pink line. You do this in rhythm to the music. So, what songs did the developers (EA Pogo and Bizzare Creations) choose? They could have chosen modern pop songs, they could have used 1960s Rock and Roll, but they didn't choose those genres. Instead, They gave us 10 songs to play on. All of these songs are classic orchestra songs from the 1890s, remixed with Drum and Bass and Techno music. These songs are: Smooth Operetta, Rave New World, William Tell Overload, Hall Of The Mountain Dude, 1812 Overdrive, Valkyries Rising, Tail Light Sonata, Carmen Electric, Game Over Beethoven and Toccata And Funk. There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. Easy is for newcomers or people who just want to enjoy the music and get everything right. Medium is for people who want to feel challenged, as the buttons come in larger amounts and run to the pink line faster. Hard is for experts only. There is also one piece of Downloadable Content, the Rock Pack, which includes 5 rock songs to play on. Boom Boom Rocket is a must-buy. The soundtrack and song choice is great, gameplay is excellent, and graphics are good. Score: 9/10. Next up on the Live Arcade Compilation Disc is Feeding Frenzy, a casual game about eating fish. In this game, you eat fish. Then you grow bigger after eating the small fish so you can eat the regular sized fish. Then you grow bigger to the big fish, although, you can't seem to eat sharks. That's the gameplay. It sounds boring, but it's really fun. On each set of levels, you play as a different fish. Feeding Frenzy is a great casual eating game with gameplay like Katamari Damacy and good-looking cartoony graphics. Score: 8/10. Next up on the Live Arcade Compilation Disc is UNO, a video game based on the card game, UNO. I haven't played the UNO card game and don't know the rules too well, so I'm not going to score this game. But if you know the rules of UNO well, this is definitely something for you. The final game on the Live Arcade Compilation Disc is Luxor 2, a good 3-in-a-row colour matching game. I'm not a big fan of the 3-in-a-row matching genre, but this is good fun. All you have to do is simply put the same coloured balls in a 3-in-a-row or more line. Doing this will explode the balls and put the line of balls back a little, temporarily preventing them from getting sucked into the Pharoh's mouth. Luxor 2 is a good 3-in-a-row colour matching game, that is fun to play or watch. It has acceptable graphics as well. Score: 7/10. Also found on the Live Arcade Compilation Disc is 2 demos, which are of: Surf's Up: The Video Game and Viva Piñata. There are more exclusive demos available on Xbox Live Marketplace (now known as Xbox Store) if you have an Xbox Live account. There is also an outdated Xbox 360 Welcome Video showing you how to navigate the old 'Blade' Dashboard. There are 2 game trailers as well, of Shrek The Third: The Video Game and Viva Piñata. Overall, the Xbox Live Arcade Compilation Disc is a must-buy. It comes with PAC-MAN Championship Edition (8/10) Boom Boom Rocket (9/10) Feeding Frenzy (8/10) UNO (no score, still recommended to UNO fans) and Luxor 2 (7/10) and, the Compilation Disc is only about £5/$10 now, so why not buy it?",0,No score yet,0,0,0,6.0,Mixed or average reviews,3,4,3

Zone of the Enders HD Collection,Xbox 360,['Konami'],High Voltage Software,"['Miscellaneous', 'Compilation', 'Compilation']",M,"Oct 30, 2012",['PlayStation 3'],No Online Multiplayer,"Let's be clear. Do not buy Zone of the Enders if you are thinking of playing Zone of the Enders. This is not what you are here for. 2nd Runner however is essential classic gaming. It is the ONLY mech fighting game I have found that is worth it's salt. The action is smooth and grace full. The game allows you to feel empowered whilst fighting numbers of enemy mechs and makes you look good whilst doing it. The anime cutscenes are amongst the best in the business to date and the fusion of the Japanese Anime with a grace full yet frantic mech fighting game is perfect. Not many people will buy it... Not many people will know it even exists... but to play it is to be converted. I believe there is a new one in the pipeline... I hope so!",75,Generally favorable reviews,11,9,1,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,17,7,3

The strengths are that if you are trying to get in shape or lose weight it will help you accomplish those goals.  My wife got it and has been using it one to two hours a day while trying to drop some weight this last week and so far hasn't been burned out.  For someone trying to lose a few pounds, it works well but might be a little too fast paced for those in poor shape.  The game provides the benefits of a Zumba workout, dancing designed to burn calories, with personal feedback as motivation to keep moving.  In helping the user to burn calories the game excels.  While the game tracks the amount of calories you burned, the interface could have been expanded to allow daily tracking of burned calories versus weekly tracking.
