4x4 EVO 2,Xbox,['Gathering'],Terminal Reality,"['Driving', 'Racing', 'Rally / Offroad']",E,14-Nov-01,['PC'],2-Jan,"I bought this game pretty recently for a good nostalgia trip, as I played this game when I was younger on Gamecube. Desperate to play it, I bought an Xbox copy instead, thinking it wouldn’t be much different. And it’s really not from what I can remember, everything that should be there is, well, there. I dunno if it’s considered cheating or not since I played it on Xbox 360 and not the original Xbox, but if it is, take this review with a grain of salt. I think that game is pretty solid is most aspects, the graphics are tight, the controls are responsive, the customization is INSANE, the car options are also INSANE, especially considering it had name brand vehicles from Chevrolet, GMC, Toyota... pretty much every well-known vehicle company aside from Ford. The game’s career mode is where you can buy and build your dream vehicle, adding roll cages, extra lights, bullbars, all sorts of aftermarket parts. The mission mode is also pretty amazing and is what I suggest you start out with first when going to play career mode, as the lag is barely noticeable, the controls are pretty responsive, and you get a big open map to search for your objective. It may take quite a while to figure everything out, but the soundtrack can help out in a lack of patience. But, again, despite this, it does tend to get tedious every now and then, but that’s what other modes are for to replenish your patience, that being the racing mode. Now this mode is a bit... not so good. The lag gets cranked way the heck up, the AI is annoying and seem to have a slight rubber-banding mechanic, vehicle collisions are a bit broken, and turning can be random due to the intense amount of lag. Because of all this it makes it dang near impossible to actually win a race, and because of it I actually have not won one single race by the time I’m writing this review. There is also no restart mechanic, so if you make a major screw-up (i.e. hit one of the checkpoint flags which you can actually do and the AI can also do pretty frequently) and you know you’re gonna lose, you’re better off just finishing the race if you’re on a final lap considering you still are going to have to go through two loading screens and a results screen. So, if you have the patience for it, I recommend sticking to missions first and racing later, since it also pays out a lot of money too. This isn’t to say the racing isn’t awful, the tracks are actually pretty good, with environment AI, shortcuts, and plenty of huge jumps. The tracks vary from a nice little race around a farmyard, to Area 51 and a nuclear waste site! Now because of this, I say you stick with time trials if you can’t stand the AI and lag that the AI causes. One more thing I think should be mentioned is the time it takes to save on 360. I dunno if it takes this long to save on the original Xbox, but it takes around 5 minutes just to save a game. I want to throw that out there since the first time I tried to save and it took that long I thought the game crashed, only to find out it saved just before I shut off my console. So, um, don’t do that. The game is most likely not broken, it just takes that long to save for some strange reason. Now, for my final verdict. Because of all this, as far as the Xbox version goes, I do recommend you play this game! But then again, I seriously suggest you stay below a budget that is around 20 dollars. Hope this review helped a few, and have fun playing 4x4 Evo 2!",59,Mixed or average reviews,4,5,6,5.7,Mixed or average reviews,2,1,3

Yes. But a surprisingly fun game under all the lack of production value. Army Men: Major Malfunction may be the last decent console game in the Army Men series, even though it's been panned by critics and fans alike. I personally enjoyed this game, though it's not for all. The Tan army is no longer the main enemy (or even mentioned in the game, like anywhere) that said, your enemies are all generic toys you'd see around any kid's room. Transformer-inspired robots, Duplo-inspired 'block-men', karate barbies..... Yeah, welcome to Major Malfunction. While obviously a huge departure for the series, it does make for enemy variety. There is also a much greater emphasis on platforming, forcing you to traverse all the many areas of the 'real world' including the bathroom, the kitchen, the backyard, the shed, and more. This added to enjoyment more than anything to me, as the environments are pretty creative and fun to explore. Don't get me wrong; Major Malfunction is a very, very problematic game. This is possibly the worst camera I have ever come upon in a video game. The thing will randomly change up angles right in the middle of platforming even. The graphics are also quite flat and blocky, and the story (if you can really call it that) consists of text boxes with muffled groans and growls as speech. Action can get a bit repetitive at times too. I kinda liked the music but it was a very limited soundtrack. In the end, I'd give this more of a 7 but it has a low enough rating as it is. Major Malfunction is by no means THAT good of a game, but it has redeeming value if you find it cheap. It's a fun little title when approached with the proper expectations.

First person mode didn't really bother me but hey at least it was better than dark tomorrows weapons controls. Batman's combat was very well done and the super moves was a blast to use and they were very good and quick to use compared to begins where begins combat system where slow and dull. Vehicles stages where awesome and the music was beautiful, which made me feel like i was in a episode of batman the animated series and environment captures the show.  Guys i know that this is old but at least ubisoft tried and gave us a good batman game where it made you feel like the dark knight and you gotta admit that the arkham games borrowed some elements  from vengeance and rise of sin tzu so without these games their would be no arkham and many people and review s such as kwing, ign and gamestop like this game. Also, i loved the stealth and quick stealth in this game. What is quick stealth? Well if people read the manual it is activated when you use a smoke bomb on a enemy and go behind the and press the y button to do a stealth take down, which is awesome and finish the combat fight smoothly in case you don't wanna fight or  you are lossing health.  Finding ammo is easy cause you just have to look around. Instead of bashing this game, i would like to thank ubisoft for redeeming themselves and worked hard in making this game because they would have just given us a half assed batman game like batman beyond return of the joker. Story was alright except for the first act but it was a good kind of alright cause it reminded me alot of the animated series and i loved the swat chase level cause it was a sort of homage to the batman mask of phantasm scene where batman was chased by the cops, which was my favorite scene and i love  playing that level.

I still play this game to this date, feeling like it is still brand new. The graphics killed every other game at the launch,even most out recently, yes including Halo, which I'm tired of hearing it still has the best graphics on the Box. No other game that I've played on the Box says XBOX like this one, at least to me. There has been only one other game like this before, being Cobra Triagle on the NES. There probably won't be another like it because of bad reviews when everyone was so caught up in Halo that everything else was overlooked or frowned upon. Also this game has millions of polygons running at 30 frames per second during the entire game which makes it difficult for a developer to make again since the first one was so overlooked and they won't spend all that time making another one(shame on you XBOX audience). I was hoping for a sequel but the so called professional reviewers screwed that up for everybody. I will only buy or play Xbox exclusives from now on because every time one of us buys a game that is also on the Playstation 2, we are not only having to settle for barely upgraded PS1 graphics, we are telling developers we will settle for barely passable games. Maybe I have forgotten what gaming is all about, but I haven't forgotten why I bought an XBOX in the first place. The most powerful hardware in a console bar-none, capable of blowing Gamecube and Gaystation 2 away. What every happened to the whole reason the XBOX was made for anyway? The graphics engine in the Box has been overlooked for far too long. It is time to awaken the monster and ""freakin' use"" the damn hardware.

Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars,Xbox,"['Encore Software, Inc.']",Kodiak Interactive,"['Driving', 'Demolition Derby']",T,24-Feb-02,,4-Jan,"Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars = Pure awesomeness. Go through the first few Academy stages to begin, there is a brief learning curve. After all, you will be driving a chariot mostly along winding hazardous roads while simultaneously wielding a weapon via the warrior on back. Literally every button has a function, and most of them are necessary at some point in a race. For example, you may need to pull left trigger for that tight left turn, or pull the left stick back to duck under a low handing branch. If you want to dial back the complexity at any point you can 1) set difficulty level to Novice (easy), and the chariot will not tip over around sharp turns (tipping is avoided by leaning your warrior into the turn), 2) turn on auto-pilot during the match, so you can focus just on attacking with your warrior, 3) in multiplayer, have a buddy control driving or fighting with their own controller while you do the other. Regardless of your starting method, I've little doubt you'll wish to control more as you progress. The more you familiarize yourself with the game controls, the more fun you'll have attempting to juggle them throughout the race. Of course the graphics will lack compared to today's games but they are plenty good, and you'll be too engaged in the action to care. All of the interaction between chariots, road hazards, warrior attacks delivered and received, all feel very fair. If a chariot wipe-out leaves you confused as to the cause, the fun auto-replay of the crash likely clues you in as to what it was. Very rarely does the chariot seem to crash for no clear reason. The chariot wipe-outs are hilarious, with horses, chariot, and occupants all tumbling, sometimes flying. The core experience I've had with this game is one which rides a nice balance of challenge, entertainment, without being overbearing. I found myself consistently seeking to improve my ability to drive and fight at the same time, because I feel rewarded for doing so. Taking out an opponent in mid-race feels great, winning the race feels like an accomplishment. Even crashing or losing the race feels exhilarating because it's so much fun and there's a feeling that your controller skills progressed a least a bit more. You want to go back in and put those skills to the test. I bought this Xbox game many years back in a bargain bin and it is still a blast to play, solo or with others. You can play up to 4 at once (2 driver/warrior tandems fighting head to head). It can be played on Xbox 360. I'm not familiar with it's availability on other platforms. Nowadays everything is online, so the dream would be to have this game remade with that capability, as well as more tracks, along with customized and upgrade-able chariots/horses/drivers/warriors. I've seen some videos in recent years of people playing this on a whim, and then discovering what a diamond in the rough it truly is. I can't say enough about this game and hope that somehow it gets resurrected. It's a shame that it got a significant amount of negative reviews from some seemingly high profile critics who obviously did not go through the tutorial or read the user manual. If you have the slightest inclination to drive a chariot at high speed while simultaneously engaging in melee weapon combat on the back portion of said chariot, then you seek Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars.",67,Mixed or average reviews,9,15,2,6.3,Mixed or average reviews,3,1,2

There isn't a slider to adjust how good the goalies play this year either which is pretty annoying. When a penalty is called now, 90% of the time it's for high sticking. It's cool that the offenses actually happen, but they could have played this game for about 10 minutes and seen the number of high sticking penalties was ridiculous. There are a lot of things I could single out as major faults in the gameplay. Just know that this is an arcade type game that looks like it should be a sim.

Urban Chaos: Riot Response,Xbox,['Eidos Interactive'],Rocksteady Studios,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Modern']",M,13-Jun-06,['PlayStation 2'],8  Online,"As others have stated, this game is HIGHLY underrated, and is one of my top underdog games of all time.  Anyone screaming that the level of uber-'murica patriotism is sickening needs to realize that this game came from a UK company and this is without a doubt satire to-the-max. As far as the gameplay goes, it appears to be the typical run-and-gun on the surface, but goes slightly deeper than that.  A wide range of weapons from two dynamically different groups, ranging from high tech firearms to lower tech cleavers to your trusty riot shield (which will endlessly save your hind-end) ensure plenty of options to dispatch your enemies.  While kill 'em all is always the easiest way to clean up the streets, some optional objectives call for less-than-lethal results. And these optional objectives, as well as numerous difficulty levels, offer different rewards in the form of new weaponry, equipment and other various perks.  And to me, this is where the replay value holds.  On one level and difficulty setting alone, one optional objective may be to run the level in X:XX time, while another calls for X headshots and another calls for the non-lethal pacification of the gang's leader.   Many times this alone may take several runs through.  Up the difficulty and you get a new set of objectives along with more aggressive enemies.  I am by no means a completionist, but I felt compelled to replay each level until I met every objective.  The only modern game that had this type of feel, in my opinion, was The Club; but that game fell short. Graphics, by the old Xbox standards for pretty fair to good.  Music in the menus is a bit repetitive but tolerable.  Voice acting, well, it fits the campy, satirical nature of the game, so no complaints there. In all honesty, this game is the only reason I've held on to my old Xbox.  It never made it to the 360 BC list, and, sadly, I don't see an HD remake coming anytime in the future.

But here are my opinions on it 15+ years later. Feels rushed. The main actors excluding Kristen Stewart reprise their role for the game. Should've had more dialogue. Soundtrack is pretty memorable. Level designs leave a lot to be desired. Bosses are easy. But its a kids game so i dont expect them to be Dark Souls hard. Overall, fun to look back on. But should've been way more.",48,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,7,8,5.4,Mixed or average reviews,1,3,1
